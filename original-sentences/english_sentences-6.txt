Previously on Heroes...
Thank god you came along.
I know Dr. Suresh.
I can take you to him.
Right after we defeat his entire army.
She won't wake up, and her vitals are getting worse.
I am taking her to the company.
The moment you trust them
With what you care about most,
They'll have you.
We have someone else who needs us.
We would like you to bring her in.
A lot of the people we encounter
Aren't in control of their ability.
But we need you out there,
Doing the good work that you do
Helping others like her.
You were with a boy.
There's no boy, dad.
I tried out for cheerleading.
But you promise me that you won't date.
Okay.
I painted that,
But all the street signs are in french.
It could be Montreal.
Ricky!
The woman who did this to Ricky,
She was looking for me.
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have let him cover for me.
It was his choice, Peter.
My brother could be a right fool sometimes.
The woman who killed Ricky,
She was looking for me.
You saw what she could do.
I'm not gonna let you be next.
I'm gonna find her,
Find out who she is, what she wants.
How are you planning on doing that?
The plane ticket, the painting.
It all points to Montreal.
It's a start.
I'm going with you.
No.
I'm not risking your life too.
We were both in that Montreal painting.
I think I'm supposed to go with you, Peter.
Besides, when you find Ricky's killer,
I want to be there.
What for?
To kill the bitch.
1, 2, 3, 4...
R- E-C-Y-C-L-E!
5, 6, 7, 8...
It's our planet, let's plant a tree!
Whoo!
Go, costa verde! Stop, please!
I can't take it anymore.
Do you realize how agonizing it is
To watch you people?
It's a no on all three.
- Next! - Are you crazy?
Claire was awesome.
I vote "Yes".
Okay, that's one vote
For Claire.
Anyone else
Care to climb out on a limb with May?
Like I said,
Next!
Thanks for trying.
Claire, you were amazing.
Really.
I don't know what Debbie's thinking.
What I'm thinking is that Costa Verde High
Deserves cheerleaders that are extra-Ordinary.
And you, Claire,
Are simply Not extra-Ordinary.
How was that?
Perfect, yet again.
How much longer are we gonna do this?
It's been hours.
I want to go home.
Soon, I promise.
Let's take a break.
Are you ever gonna tell me what's going on here?
Where are we?
I mean, you just grabbed me off the street-
You're in Hartsdale, New York,
At a privately funded company
Whose sole purpose is to help you
And others like you.
Others like me?
Not exactly like you.
Others have different gifts,
But you're the first we've met
With adoptive muscle memory.
So that's what it's called.
Why is this happening to me?
We're not really sure.
There are certain genetic markers,
But where they come from is still a mystery.
You have been given an extraordinary gift.
I agree.
You are a very special person, Miss Dawson.
Who are you?
My name is Bob.
I'm in charge of operations.
Doctor,
Could I see you for a moment?
Have you established a reliable baseline
For Miss Dawson's ability?
Yes. She is able to replicate any action.
It's really quite extraordinary.
Good.
Now,
We could determine
If this stops all of that.
What is that?
A variant of the Shanti virus.
You're experimenting with the virus?
Manipulating a live virus
Is essential for creating a vaccine, doctor.
We hope to use this virus
To take away Monica's ability
Without harming her.
You could create an incurable strain.
It could cross over to the general population.
Think how many people were killed by Gabriel Gray.
There are some abilities in this world
That must be stopped at any cost.
Monica is a sweet girl who loves her abilities.
We can't just take them away from her.
It's for the greater good.
So she's a lab rat.
You're just going to inject her without her consent.
No, Dr. Suresh, you are.
It's a mutated strain, manufactured.
If the biological structure of the virus has been altered,
I don't know if I can save her.
She could die.
You're just gonna have to take that chance.
I never agreed to experiment on people.
You brought them Molly, didn't you?
I didn't know what else to do.
All right, look.
If you refuse to do this,
They're gonna get rid of you,
And then we're gonna lose
Everything that we've been trying to do.
And worse yet, you're gonna lose Molly.
Now you've got principles, and that's fine.
But to bring down this company,
Sometimes we have to do bad things.
Don't disappoint me, Suresh.
Something wrong?
I lied to my dad.
The other night when I went home,
I told him I'd joined cheer-leading.
Cheer-leading? That is bad.
You don't understand.
Cheer-leading tryouts were last period.
I didn't make it.
What am i supposed to tell him?
You met this awesome guy,
And you need some free time to make out.
I told you my dad's really overprotective
About the whole dating thing.
He told me I couldn't date until I was 21.
- So? - So I have to listen to my parents.
Don't you?
Claire, I can fly.
It kind of makes the whole parental guidance thing
A non-Issue.
But if it's that important to you,
We'll figure out a way to get you on the team. It's impossible.
Debbie Marshall does not deem me Extra-Ordinary enough.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
You're a total babe, and you have a power.
By definition, you're better than she is.
Oh, you're sweet.
But it's not just her.
She's got that whole squad
Wrapped around her evil little pinky.
I knew girls just like her at my old school.
All would take is one person to stand up to her.
Well, be that person.
Take her down a notch.
How?
You were a cheerleader.
What do they fear most?
Public humiliation?
We could give her a taste of her own medicine.
Your ability is fascinating.
A gift.
What I do is terrible.
I have taken many lives,
And I can't control it.
I was like you.
I could do things, amazing things.
You?
Like what?
I could move objects with my mind.
I could hear a pin drop from miles away.
But then it all just...
Went away.
That's why I need to see Dr. Suresh,
To get them back.
You want to be different?
I want to be special,
Unique.
An ability doesn't have to be a burden, Maya.
It can be wonderful.
Is there a problem?
My brother wants to hire a coyote,
To cross the border without you.
Why?
You can't trust them.
It's okay.
We'll cross the border together.
I'm glad to have found you, Gabriel.
Isaac Mendez...
Painted a series of eight paintings
Beginning with Kaito Nakamura's death
And ending in mine.
Where are they?
Sorry, I'm retired.
I work in the textile factory now.
Regional Manager of Sales,
Like you in the paper company.
Cut the crap.
Where are the paintings?
You think you intimidate me?
I trained you,
You and your invisible partner Claude.
I taught you everything!
Then you know what I'm capable of.
Don't make me do this.
What is this?
You want information?
The Haitian can't help you.
My friend has a new trick.
He can reach inside that Company-loving head of yours
And one by one, blot out all the memories
You hold most dear.
Think about it,
A man of your advanced years.
Treasured memories give your life meaning.
Your wedding in Capri.
The births of Andre and Mikhail.
It'd be a shame if they disappeared,
Lost forever.
Start with the day he met his wife.
Tell me about Katarina.
Your honeymoon.
Her favorite flower.
I can't remember.
Really?
After 35 years together, such a shame.
Are you ready to talk,
Or do we keep going?
Hi, honey.
Is everything all right?
Hey, dad, yeah.
I was just wondering if I could borrow the car tonight.
Did you ask your mother?
I did, and she said to ask you.
I'm gonna be with the cheerleaders later.
Just thought you should know.
Full disclosure and all.
Well, that's very responsible of you, Claire.
Take the car.
But do one thing for me.
Sure.
Lock the doors this time.
I will. Thanks.
Is there something else?
Where are you right now?
I told you. Management training in Tulsa.
And I'm late for a session.
Well, I thought you had to work there a year
Before they'd send you.
I'm a quick learner.
I've gotta go.
I love you, Claire-Bear.
I love you too, dad.
What do you think?
Okay.
I'm in.
Your daughter, Claire?
It must be very difficult for her,
The constant fear of discovery,
Especially for a teenager.
Aren't you tired of running?
I'm protecting her from animals like you.
You can't hide forever.
Take all his memories of me, my family,
Claire, everything I ever told him.
He remembers nothing!
Wait!
I'm like you.
Family comes first.
Maybe we can make a deal.
What kind of deal?
You were my protege,
So dedicated to the company, you made me proud.
I miss that.
I want you back.
Forget it.
The company has changed.
We have new directives.
Come back to us and you'll be safe,
All of you.
You have my word.
What about the paintings?
You'll be told everything.
I can give you your life back.
Trust me.
What is that?
A border fence, not finished yet.
That is America right there.
Attention, you're in violation of U.S. immigration!
We have notified border patrol.
All right, boys, Andale, Andale.
Let's see them hands.
Who are they?
They're locals, not border patrol.
They're fake police. Just drive around them.
What's-What's that for?
A Cholinergic. 
It's standard procedure
To see if your ability improves.
Uh-Uh, no way. I won't do needles.
It's the last phase of your testing.
One shot, you can go home.
Fine.
Just make it fast.
I can't do this.
Dr. Suresh?
I won't do it.
If you don't, someone else will.
And there's more where that came from.
Stop!
What are you doing?!
Get someone else to do your research.
I'm taking Molly, and I'm leaving.
All right, boys, this is your last warning.
Vamanos.
We have to go. They will shoot us.
Just drive, now!
No, no, no, no, no.
Let her alone.
We need to get past these men,
These guns.
You can use your gift.
No.
Drive.
The next time you think
Of that second helping of chunky monkey,
Remember one thing.
The sharpie doesn't lie.
Appearance matters, girls.
Is this really necessary?
Hell, yes.
I might have to basket catch one of these tubettes.
Debbie, can I talk to you for a minute?
Private function, butler.
Cheerleaders only.
I'll do your biology homework for a week.
You have five minutes.
I want another chance,
Another shot at tryouts.
I appreciate the effort, really.
Attempting to better your social status at school
Is very American dream of you.
But everyone has their place in this world.
Deal with it.
So you're not gonna change your mind?
You are slow, aren't you?
Claire?
Claire?!
Claire?!
Oh, my god.
She was right there.
Her neck was twisted.
She was bleeding.
I went to see if I could help her,
And that's when he came after me.
The flying masked man?
Yes!
I escaped, thank goodness,
But Claire was dead,
Right there on the steps.
I saw her. She's-
What's going on?
But I saw you.
That thing dropped you.
Debbie, calm down. I'm fine.
I don't supposed you saw a...
Flying masked man this evening?
Me? No. No.
Uh, I was just hanging out with Debbie.
Find anything, Ray?
No dead bodies.
I did find this.
How much have you had to drink tonight, Miss Marshall?
We don't have much time.
The sun will rise soon.
Yaeko's father is there.
You take out the guard, we will follow.
You've given me purpose, carp.
I'm really a hero.
And more, you've made me a better man.
Well...
You wouldn't happen to have a swordsmith in there,
Would you?
I know. It's really unfair.
That was easy enough.
You must stop them.
Destroy all the guns!
That is how you save Japan.
Very well.
Can I speak with you for a moment?
I owe you an apology.
What I asked you to do was wrong.
I've been with the company for 30 years.
We've been through a lot of turmoil
And made a lot of difficult choices,
Some I regret to this day.
But right now I'm dealing with someone
Who is a real danger to us,
To everyone,
And I'm afraid that in my haste to deal with him,
I overstepped my bounds.
The file you were holding, Adam Monroe.
Yes.
You're valuable to us, Dr. Suresh,
Not just for your blood or your knowledge,
But to keep us in line.
Molly still isn't well,
So I can't take her away from here.
But you've given me no reason to trust you.
I know, I know.
We both have a lot at stake.
I have someone at my disposal,
Someone who can make sure
There's no further misunderstandings.
Sound good?
I don't really have a choice, do i?
Alejandro!
I will get something for your lip.
I know you don't understand me.
But I want to tell you why I'm helping you.
It's that delicious power.
You see, when I get my ability back,
I'm gonna kill you...
And your sister.
And I'm gonna take it all.
And if I don't get my ability back,
It's not a total loss.
Maya's learning quickly.
She's a shiny new toy,
And she's all mine.
I can't believe you talked me into that.
What?
Somebody could have seen us.
Relax. No one saw.
And no one will ever believe Debbie.
Did you see her face?
Classic.
Is she gonna be okay?
Definitely.
She freaked, but just think of it
As a lesson in humility.
Claire.
Oh.
Hope I'm not interrupting.
No, it's okay. How's Debbie?
She blew a. 13.
Drinking on school grounds.
Got suspended from the cheerleading squad
Immediately.
Which means we have an opening.
First practice is Monday after school.
You mean it? I'm on the team?
Sure. You were the best at try-Outs.
I'll just let you two get back to...
Whatever.
I'll see you Monday.
Tell me something, Ivan.
In all the years I've known you,
Why have you never mentioned a daughter?
This daughter.
She died, didn't she?
Leukemia.
I'm so sorry.
That must have been so painful.
I can't even imagine losing Claire.
To think...
All you have left of her
Are your memories.
It would be awful if they were taken.
Almost as if she never existed.
Please don't.
Take the daughter.
Don't leave anything.
Wait!
It's in the warehouse near the train yard.
Where we tagged the liquid man.
You'll find your paintings there.
Thank you.
Now what?
Your haitian friend makes sure
That'll I'll forget that you were ever here?
I wish it were that easy.
Once the company discovers your memory loss,
They're gonna trace it back to the haitian,
Which leads to my family.
And I can't have it.
What are you doing?
You taught me well, my friend.
You said, "make it look as if you were never there. "
So now we weren't.
Instead, there was a simple home invasion,
A senseless murder.
I am offering you a way out.
You can stop running!
Shoot me and there is no turning back.
You'll condemn yourself to hell.
I know.
Kensei, I've been searching for hours.
Come, my friend.
We must go back and destroy Whitebeard's guns.
If you want to stop him, do it yourself.
Something wrong?
I saw you, Hiro.
After I saved the swordsmith,
I came after you,
Afraid something had happened to Yaeko,
Because I love her.
And you, friend, betrayed me.
- No. - Yes. You kissed her.
It happened...
By accident.
You accidentally kissed her?
I accidentally
Fell in love with her,
And she with me.
I'm so sorry.
So you've been lying to me all along.
First you show me that I can be harmed by no weapon,
And then you cut me deeper than any blade possibly could.
She's your princess, Kensei.
I know that.
And I swear I will not give in to love.
That kiss will be our last.
But the fate of the world still rests in our hands.
We must stop Whitebeard.
All right, carp.
Let's go.
You're covered at work and at home,
An impromptu burger bonanza
Training seminar at corporate.
Here.
What's this?
Information. Phone numbers.
If you have any questions or concerns,
I want you to call us anytime, day or night.
Also, here.
It's fully loaded.
Anything from martial arts to plumbing,
Any skill you want is now at your fingertips.
Wow.
Support, advice, and now gifts.
You're like my own personal Oprah.
You have an amazing gift.
So look around.
Seems to me like this town could use a little amazing.
Thanks.
Right.
Hello, Dr. Suresh.
Niki?
How are you?
I'm feeling better now.
Back to my old self, thanks to the company.
In fact, I'm gonna be working with them
For a while.
So you're-
Your new partner.
I know.
It's the last place that I expected to be,
But... i owe these people so much.
Bob told me that you two were having
Some trust issues.
He just wants me to make sure
That there's no more misunderstandings.
That's okay, isn't it?
What does it mean?
Are you ready?
Yeah.
What is this place?
I don't know.
Someone knew I was coming.
"We were right about the Company.
"The world is in danger.
It's up to us. Adam. "
The name Adam doesn't ring a bell?
No, and I don't know about any Company.
I don't know about any of this.
"The world is in danger. "
What am i supposed to do?
We'll figure it out.
Please tell me who I am,
What the future holds.
Peter, how did we-
I don't know.
We're in New York.
Where is everyone?
It's an evacuation order.
June 14, 2008.
This is next year.
