Previously on Heroes.
Plane ticket, painting... It all points to Montreal.
What is this place?
"We were right about the company. The world is in danger. Adam. "
Please tell me who I am. What the future holds.
We'll figure it out.
- We're in New York. - Where is everyone?
- It's an evacuation order. - June 14, 2008.
This is next year.
This thing we could do, it only begins at reading minds.
And then it becomes so much more.
My dad can put a thought into anyone's head.
Now we know why Molly calls him the nightmare man.
It's Bob.
- He runs the Company. - Looks like he's next.
You sure you're gonna be able to cure me?
In exchange, we're going to want a little something from you.
Hello, Dr. Suresh.
- So you're... - Your new partner.
Oh, my God!
- Did you see her face? - Somebody could have seen us!
Relax! Just think of it as a lesson in humility.
What's on your neck?
Last thing I remember,
this man stepping out of the bushes, calling my name.
What are you talking about? What man?
The guy with the horn-rimmed glasses.
Wait, it's the warehouse near the train yard.
You will find your paintings there.
I saw you, Hiro.
And you, friend, betrayed me.
You can't stop time with your nose stuck in a dollop of opium.
You hear that, carp?
She thinks she loves you.
Poor, pitiful you.
You are supposed to be a hero.
After I lead White Beard's army to victory,
I will be the greatest leader Japan has ever known.
Have they given you a gun?
What are you talking about?
A gun. Company issue.
Where have you been? I need to talk to you.
I found the paintings.  The series that leads up to my death.
- Where? How? - Ukraine.
An old friend helped me find them.
And I'm looking at one of you holding a Company gun.
- I don't have a gun. - These paintings are all random.
I need you to help me make sense of them.
I'm gonna forward them to you right now. 
That's what I've been trying to say. They've given me a partner.
- That's just standard protocol. - It isn't. 
She's here to watch every move I make. They don't trust me.
My family is in danger.
So that makes me expendable?
We were supposed to take the Company down together, but you...
I don't know what your agenda is anymore.
I have to go.
Bob needs to see us.
I get it. You don't want a partner. But that's not my call.
So you admit it. You're a guard dog.
Where's everyone going?
I'm evacuating the facility.
- Why? - I'll let them explain it to you.
Officer Parkman. Mr. Petrelli.
I thought you were gonna find your father.
I did. He attacked Angela Petrelli.
My father killed Kaito Nakamura. He's killing them all.
And now he's coming to kill Bob.
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
There's no one here, Peter. They've all gone.
Evacuated by homeland security.
- Peter, what did you do? - Me? I didn't do anything.
Are you sure?
We were in Montreal.
I picked up a note from some guy named Adam who says the world is in danger.
Next thing you know, we're here.
One year in the future. I mean, how is that even possible?
Over there. Get on the ground!
Get on the ground now!
Do you have any symptoms?
Are you sick?
Sick? What the hell is going on?
Take them to decontamination now!
HEROES 207- "OUT OF TIME"

CHAPTER SEVEN - "OUT OF TIME"
- Mom, did you make waffles? - Nope. West did.
I wanted to bring you breakfast.
I hope you don't mind.
Why would she mind?
Because he wasn't invited, and some people think that's rude?
Nonsense.
Your dad and I love meeting your friends.
- Will Mr. Butler be joining us? - Sadly, no.
His business trip was extended. Something about...
Something I wasn't paying any attention to.
Lyle, get your butt out of bed!
He's adorable.
Why would you come here when I told you not to?
I had to show you something.
Check it out.
We're infamous.
Drunk cheerleader suspended. Claims that she saw a boy fly.
What are we gonna do? People are gonna know it was us.
How? It's a blurb. On the last page of the local flavor section. It's no big.
It is big.
You can't just do whatever you want whenever you want.
I just wanna be a part of your life.
But just for waffles.
How do you know your father's coming to kill Bob?
Isn't this all a bit reactionary?
Matt's right. Security just found his car ditched off the road.
Maury could be here right now.
I'm taking you into protective custody. My first priority's to keep you safe.
You can't. You couldn't keep Angela Petrelli safe.
She almost killed herself on your watch.
No, we stop Maury here now.
- You realize that makes you the bait. - We all have our roles to play.
That's what Linderman used to say.
My mother too. It's always these half-truths.
No straight answers. Constant manipulation.
- I'm trying to help everyone here. - How, Bob?
What the hell did you people do?
Why is maury coming here to kill you?
Now is not the time to recount the past.
But to focus on the task at hand.
All right! Fine, so we stay here. How do we stop my father?
I need you and Niki to inject maury with the virus.
Virus?
What virus?
The virus takes away abilities. It's also potentially lethal.
- You said we'd never use it again. - Circumstances have changed.
I will not knowingly spread this virus.
Maury is a killer. He knows your thoughts, your nightmares,
and he could turn your world inside out.
We take away his abilities,
and then you can cure him with the antibodies in your blood.
No one dies here today.
He's not gonna exactly volunteer for a shot.
- I can be persuasive. - I appreciate the thought.
But this one goes to you, Matt.
What? Me? All I can do is read minds.
You have the same abilities as Maury has.
Anything the brain controls, you control.
- Senses, actions, thoughts... - No! No, I can't.
I can't do any of that stuff.
Well, then you better learn fast
because you're the only one who could stop your father.
Caitlin!
Caitlin! Caitlin! Caitlin!
Peter Petrelli?
According to these files, you're a dead man.
What?
I got your death certificate right here.
So...
You're gonna have to explain to me,
how's a dead man walk around New York city with no sign of infection?
Infection?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where's Caitlin? I need to see her.
She's from Ireland. All foreigners are deported.
You can't do that! Who the hell are you people?
What's going on here?
You really don't know.
On march 20th, 2007 the first case was reported.
After that the Shanti virus spread across the globe.
A pandemic.
It's killed 93% of the world's population to date.
The rest of us live in quarantine praying to find a cure.
This can't be happening.
I wish it wasn't.
All these people died from the virus?
Yeah, it's been a tough week.
I'm supposed to be out hunting down Maury,
but I needed to see you.
I never should have asked you to use your...
ability to find my dad.
You were just tryin'to make me happy.
I know that feeling.
When my dad left I...
I blamed myself. I thought that I was...
too slow... too...
fat.
Too stupid.
I thought that if I was...
better, or if I was smarter,
he would a stayed.
And now they want me...
they think that I can stop him, that I've got this power.
And I don't.
I don't.
I need you to hear.
I need you to know that I love you.
Did you just hear me?
I love you, Molly. 
What's left of the virus is in the lab.
Each syringe contains only one dose, so use it wisely.
You don't trust Bob, do you?
Did he put you up to this?
I put me up to this. I wanna hear your side.
Bob is morally gray at best. And the virus?
He's toying with a death sentence.
You have the cure. No one dies.
Just because he's a safety net doesn't make it ethical.
You would make a different choice?
Morally un-gray?
I killed a lot of people... brutally ripped them in half.
They could have given me the virus,
but they didn't.
They've made me right, so that I could have a life.
Go home to my son.
You're never gonna have a life.
You're not cured.
You're a killer.
And before this day is over you're gonna kill everyone.
Go on.
Tell him what you're seeing.
He'll think you've gone crazy again.
And then you'll never see Micah.
Is everything all right?
Let's go.
I know these other families. Linderman, Nakamura, Pratt, Deveaux.
Everyone who's been killed. But I don't know this one. Who is he?
Who's Adam Monroe?
Adam is...
complicated.
So un-complicate it.
Adam convinced us that we belonged together.
That we could make the world a better place for our children...
for you.
Snow falls on Miami.
I don't get it.
That headline could have read "Tsunami wipes out eastern seaboard".
What does any of this have to do with the murders?
Adam is the one who's trying to kill us.
- I thought Maury Parkman was... - Maury's the weapon, blunt instrument.
Adam was the visionary.
But with these abilities,
sometimes people tend to think of themselves as Gods.
Did you ever think that, Nathan?
Adam did.
And he began to talk about holocausts, plagues.
Punishing humanity in order to save the world.
Sounds a lot like Linderman.
Linderman was Adam's disciple.
Adam was dangerous.
So we locked him up.
We threw away the key.
Two weeks ago he escapes.
And now he wants revenge.
It sounds like you're reaping what you sow.
- Why should I care? - Because of Peter.
Listen, Pal,
you wanna talk about my brother,
you better be very careful what you say next.
Peter is alive, Nathan.
Your brother is alive.
I'll leave you two alone.
Do I know you?
They brought me here to help you, Peter.
You need to remember who you are.
- I need to find Caitlin. - You need to focus.
You can move objects with your mind, heal, you can paint the future.
How do you know about that?
You absorb abilities from other people. You are the most powerful of us all.
You're a kind and caring soul. Selfless. Always thinking about others.
But now you need to think about yourself and fly into the face of danger.
Just like your brother.
I have a brother.
He died in the first outbreak.
But you...
- You can change that. - How?
I was in Montreal in 2007.
- The next thing I know, I'm here. - You met a man named Hiro Nakamura.
He can travel in time. So can you. You can change history.
- I can't. - You must!
I can't control these things that are happening to me!
Then this virus will kill us all.
Peter, you need to remember.
You need to remember. 
Mom?
Do the marks hurt?
They're kinda just there.
Painless souvenirs of my alien abduction from the guy with horn-rimmed glasses.
If you're gonna be dropping in, there's something I need to tell you.
I get it.
- Get what? - I'm moving too fast.
We don't have to go any further if you don't want to.
You know what I want?
Popsicles.
Popsicles.
Awesome.
Raspberry or blue?
- He found us. - Who?
The man who abducted me. We've gotta get outta here.
Come on.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
The guy in the glasses is my father.
What is this?
Some sort of trap?
- No, just listen to me. - Back off.
Wait.
Who are you talkin'to?
No one.
You've got two popsicles.
Welcome home.
All this trouble over one drop of liquid.
This virus could kill an entire species.
Or it could stop Maury and save our lives.
Poor Niki. So vulnerable. 
You're perfect. Show me your nightmares. 
Show me your thoughts. Show me your soul. 
How do I turn you into a killer?
Nothing's going to save you.
This company is bad.
You're not making up for your son's.
You're diggin'deeper into hell, and worse,
you're gonna drag Micah right down with you.
You're wrong.
They said that they would help me.
Niki, what are you talkin'about?
I was sick.
I'm still sick.
- How can you say that? - Because you're dead.
No, I'm not.
They don't want me talkin'to you. They're using you, Nik.
Just like Linderman. Just like Jessica.
You can still do the right thing.
You have to kill him.
That's the only way you can save Micah.
Niki, you're talking to yourself.
I think it's Maury. We need to call Bob.
This many guns in Japan, they will crush history.
I cannot let white beard win.
We can still stop this...
together.
We did make a good team, you and I.
You showed me how to be a hero.
How to love.
And then...
you took it all away.
Do it, Hiro. Stop time. Kill me. Cut off my head.
I will not do it.
I still have faith in you.
The honorable Hiro Nakamura. He won't kill you.
He'll just lie, cheat, and steal.
I wanted to help you become a hero.
I never claimed to be anything more than a happy drunk.
Do not punish the world for my mistakes!
I only want to punish you, Hiro.
Yaeko was right.
She's not destined to be my princess. She's destined to die.
Take my hand. We must get out of here now.
As long as I have breath, anything you love, I will lay to waste.
I swear.
This was taken three months ago right here.
- Is he here now? - No. He's gone.
Gone where?
What is it you're not telling me? I need to know everything.
He was in cork, Ireland, and then we lost track of him.
Lost track of him?
How do you lose someone? How do you lose someone?
Dad!
Matt!
What are you doing in here? Where are we?
This is where he keeps me.
What?
When I tried to find your dad, he locked me in here.
- Now we're both trapped. - No. No, we're not.
Dad!
- Did you bring me here? - I think...
I think I did.
- Step back, Nathan. - I got it.
Don't do it, Niki. This isn't you.
- Don't do it. - How can you defend him? He killed D.L.
I didn't kill anyone. It's Maury. He's gotten inside of your head.
This is a nightmare. This isn't you.
Don't be his puppet! You're stronger than this.
You came here to get control of your life.
Don't let maury undo all of that.
Listen to me.
Think of your son. Think of Micah.
Think of your boy.
I couldn't get the nightmare out.
I didn't know what else to do.
I had to stop myself.
Don't be scared. We're gonna get out of here.
Do you recognize this room?
Yeah, of course. This is our old placeon parthenia.
Brisket and potatoes. This is the night you left.
I never apologized.
You weren't sorry. You walked out that door, you never even turned back.
You think this didn't hurt me?
This broke my heart.
I love you, Matt.
Then turn yourself in.
That's not gonna happen.
- There's no prison that can hold me. - I think there is!
I think I can trap you in here just like you trapped Molly.
- How are you gonna do that? - Look around, pop.
This isn't my nightmare! This is yours!
- I can walk right out that door. - No, you can't.
- I have to. Come on. - You can't!
Because you're not strong enough!
Because you're still that scared little boy!
No! I'm not scared of you anymore!
I'm a good man! I'm a good cop!
I'm a good father, which is something you know nothing about.
You don't know what it's like to fight for someone that you love.
You left.
You left.
All you have are your nightmares.
- Let's get out of here. - Don't leave me.
Don't leave me alone! No!
Matt?
God.
Molly, the nightmare's over. He's never gonna hurt you again.
Ever. I promise.
Oh, God, I love you.
I heard.
So what happens next?
Where do all these people go?
Same place we are, home.
Peter! Peter!
- Caitlin! - Peter! I'm so scared!
Please don't let them take me away from you.
- I'll get us home. I promise. - Please. Don't let them take me.
Caitlin!
The antibodies in my blood will eradicate
any traces of the virus in your system.
Your nose,
Does it hurt?
Only when I breathe.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
You weren't in control.
This can't be right.
What's wrong?
The antibodies aren't working This isn't possible. Not now.
It's another strain of the virus.
It's immune. My blood's no longer a cure.
I'm going to die?
This strain has no cure.
Are you certain of these results?
We'll keep maury sedated. We'll destroyevery last vial.
I promise.
- What is this? - It's a chance to save Niki.
We got a police report.
A girl walks away from a 50-foot fall without a scratch.
Cellular regeneration?
Her name is Claire Bennet.
You remember her father, Noah?
He worked for us.
Of course. He's not exactly gonna let us take his daughter, is he?
Are you saying we should kill him?
I'm saying we should be prepared.
This is Ivan Spector.
Our man in the Ukraine. He was Bennet's friend, his mentor.
Bennet killed him.
- When was this? - Last night.
Are you sure it was him?
He left fingerprints. Bennet is getting sloppy, emotional...
and that means dangerous.
I have something I need to tell you.
I have been working with Bennet to take down this company.
Why are you telling me this now?
Because...
I am unsure of who's right and who's wrong.
And it is time to stop playing games.
There's a storm coming, Dr. Suresh.
Claire is the key.
Her regenerative abilities, they could cure the virus.
She could save Niki.
I want to do the right thing here.
For Niki.
For everyone.
So did you meet him?
Meet who?
The boyfriend, West. He was here today.
Claire has a boyfriend?
I checked him out, he's fine.
You cannot be the only man in her life forever.
No, I suppose not.
We knew this day would come.
West, please answer me
You wanna tell me about this?
- It's nothing. - Nothing.
"The cheerleader claims she saw her teammate fall 50 feet to her death. "
That's nothing.
I asked you to do one thing, Claire.
I asked you to keep your nose clean.
Debbie was drunk. Nobody believes her.
Did your boyfriend make you do this?
- Are you kidding me? - Answer me.
It's none of your business!
Your tiny rebellions are putting this family in danger!
Me?
What about you, dad?
You think any of us really believe that you were out at a copy conference?
Where were you, out abducting people?
What is going on down here?
- What did Claire do this time? - Shut up, Lyle!
It's not safe here anymore.
- Pack your bags. We're moving. - You can't do that.
This is not a discussion.
We're leaving.
Then you're going without me.
Adam.
Adam. I don't know any Adam.
Peter, what the hell was that?
- Do you know me? - Of course I know you.
It's me, Adam.
Don't you remember?
You and I are going to change history.
