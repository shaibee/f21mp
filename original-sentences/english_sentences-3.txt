Previously on Heroes...
we find people and we make sure they don't become dangerous.
And you yourself wanted to put a bullet in the brain of a man named Sylar.
He's no longer a threat. He's dead.
They finally took the bait.
They caught up with me in Cairo.
I'm in.
Find out what you can.
I'll find the other paintings myself.
I was only given the first.
There's seven more.
What's in the other paintings?
I don't know.
No way.
You might want this, peter.
This here is everything you had on you when we found you.
It's all yours.
You just have to help us with one little job.
Just tell me what I need to do to get my life back.
You mean this?
The box with your identity in it?
Sure. It's all yours.
As long as you do us one favor, yeah?
See, Celtic is taking on AC Milan.
we're talkin' football, yeah?
Soccer.
I lost my memory. I'm not an idiot.
The local sports book will be full of cash.
After the match, all that money gets put in a lockbox and taken to an armored car.
So you're gonna Roban armored car.
All we're askin' is that you get rid of the guards before they call for help.
Simple, really.
So if I get you your box, you'll give me mine.
Everyone wins.
Not everybody, sideshow.
That cash is mine. Even if I have to kill you for it.
What did you say?
I- I didn't say a word.
You said you were gonna take the cash.
Are you accusing me of something?
I heard what you said. He said it.
You see that?
That's the family crest.
These lads are me brothers.
And I trust 'em a hell of a lot more than I trust you.
Why would I lie?
I know will.
I don't know you.
You don't even know yourself.
I know. I'm sorry.
I don't want to leave Las Vegas.
If there was any other way, Micah...
We're a family.
We're supposed to stay together.
This is our chance at a fresh start.
Without dad?
Hey.
I promise you, whenever you want to see your father,
I will make sure that happens.
It's time for us to say good-bye.
Hey.
No, he's still sleeping.
What can I say? The guy's tired.
You-he's waking up.
I'll have to call you later. Yeah.
Good morning, sleepyhead.
You wanna go for a dip?
Where am I?
We're in Maui.
Nice, huh?
Feel those trade winds.
Who are you?
I'm Michelle.
I used to go by Candice, but ever since I pulled you off of Kirby Plaza...
the police have kind of been looking for my old self.
I'm going for a new look.
What do you think?
You dragged me off Kirby Plaza?
After you got stabbed through the chest with a Samurai sword.
Eight surgeries later and here we are.
Which reminds me, don't try to move or you'll rip your stitches.
Daiquiri?
Stitches?
There's nothing there.
I covered 'em up.
I make illusions.
It's kinda my thing.
So none of this is real?
Show me what's really going on here.
Honey, you really don't want to know.
Show me
Heroes Season 03 Episode 02 "KINDRED"
Hey.
Your mom made waffles.
Uh, okay.
I'll be down in a minute.
You were right to be angry.
You tried to talk to me, and I lost my temper.
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine.
I shouldn't have ambushed you with all those questions.
Of course you should, Claire.
I've asked you to carry around a heck of a secret.
And I think sometimes I don't appreciate how difficult that must be.
So if you have anything you want to ask me,
as long as we're in the privacy of our own home, please, ask away.
If someone here found out about me, what would happen?
We'd have to leave California immediately.
Go deeper into hiding.
Maybe forgo schools and jobs altogether.
That's worst case scenario.
It was a pedicure.
I'm sorry.
The other night.
That's what I was doing.
I was giving myself a pedicure.
You're not very good at it.
What is it with you creeping around my house at night anyway?
Just tryin' to lend you a book.
Okay, you know what, if I want to start a book club with you, I'll let you know.
Until then, just stay away from me.
Will do.
Just walk me through this one last time.
I didn't see you cut off your toe, is that right?
The bottle of nail polish fell over and it just looked like it was bleeding.
Improvising is really not your forte.
Why are you such a smart-ass?
Why are you so bad at lying?
I'm not lying.
Fine then. You gave yourself a pedicure.
And your toe came off and then came back on.
Works for me.
I'm going to class.
Don't do your nails on the way.
Freeze!
Oh, for god's sake.
Mohinder.
Quiet down.
You'll wake Molly.
What are you doing home? I thought you were in Cairo.
Haiti, actually.
My plane got in a couple of hours ago.
I'll be working here in the city from now on.
I thought you were in the field.
They're setting me up in a place downtown.
Which means I'll be around to help with Molly.
Which means you're going to be doing your spy work in our own back yard-Great.
Someone's grouchy when they don't get their sleep.
Molly's struggling.
Nightmares, problems at school.
I can't babysit her and you at the same time.
And why would I need babysitting?
You're in over your head.
- Thank you, but- - they abducted me.
Kept me prisoner.
I know you think you can beat them at their own game,
but, Mohinder, no offense, you're a professor.
You're not 007.
I told myself I would do whatever it took to take down the company.
That's how I can help Molly.
You want to help Molly?
Don't die on her.
Mohinder, you're home!
That's right.
And I'm never leaving again.
What in heaven?
All this blood and no wound.
You have a power!
An amazing power!
What have you done to me?
This is how you become a hero!
This is impossible.
This must be some sort of trick.
No. Look.
Lazarus risen.
You've cursed me.
No. This is not a curse.
It's a gift.
This gift will help you through the trials.
To help find the fire scroll, uh, the 90 hungry ronins, help rescue Yaeko's father.
Get away from me!
You're a devil.
No, no. I'm here to help you.
Kensei, wait!
We have to write history!
Lightning.
Lightning!
Sparks!
Lightning!
So you just yell it out.
Well, I'm just trying to understand how it works.
That makes two of us.
So far, I got nothin'.
Well, it's a shame you can't order lightning up like a plate of chips.
Sure would come in handy tonight.
God, you know, I can do all these things.
It's just-I feel powerless.
It's tough not knowing who you are.
Yeah, looks like I might just die before I ever figure it out.
Maybe you're an extraterrestrial, escaped from a government facility.
I have to admit, I'm pretty excited to see you open that box.
And don't worry about tonight.
I'll be there to watch your back.
How do I know I can trust you?
I haven't told anyone about what you can do, now have I?
Why is that?
Girl's gotta have her secrets.
Dude, you look like ass.
No English.
All right.
Today, we are talking about Mitosis.
Yes, West.
I have a question about yesterday's topic.
"Regeneration in lizards. "
Now, I know you said humans couldn't regenerate.
But what if a lizard were to mate with a human?
Could their offspring do it?
Because I think I met a lizard girl.
This doesn't strike me as a productive conversation, West.
But seriously.
What if that lizard girl were to accidentally cut off her arm,
or a leg, or you name the appendage, in some kind of...
horrifying spa-debacle?
Where exactly are you going with this?
Would said appendage reattach itself back onto her lizard body?
I cut myself and the wound heals
over and over again.
You are a hero, like me.
I have powers too.
You?
- Really? - Yes.
I can stop time and move through space.
Hello.
How are such things possible?
Some say it's a gift from God.
Some people think it's evolution.
What is that? Evolution?
It means you can heal from any wound.
Really?
Any wound?
Sword?
Serpent?
Fire?
This'll make me richer than the Pope.
- Rich? - Yes!
Swordsman are obsessed with duels in this country.
I'll clean up in wages.
You have to defeat white beard and fight the 90 angry Ronin.
If you're obsessed with my stories so much, how about you handle them?
Kensei, you have to stopwalking away from your destiny!
Who's going to stop me?
Who?
No one is going to stop me because no one can stop me.
God. This is extraordinary!
Where have you taken me?
To get the fire scroll.
It's on top of those steps.
Who are they?
Those are the 90 angry ronin, sworn to protect it.
How angry are they?
Good luck, Kensei.
You can do this.
I take it you're annoyed.
What is it, West?
What do you want from me?
I want you to admit you're different.
Okay, fine.
I'm a freak. All right?
Claire.
I am such a freak, in fact,
that I have to tiptoe around this school pretending to be some brainless barbie doll
so nobody notices how different I am.
'Cause if they found out, I'd be carted off to some human zoo
so I could be poked and prodded at for the rest of my life.
So yeah, West, I'm different.
And you can tell the world if you want to,
because I am tired of pretending to be someone I'm not.
Claire, shut up.
Be careful.
You too.
Yes, who's there?
Safeline. Here for the pickup.
I want my money back.
All right, back away, friend.
I'm not your friend, okay?
Just give me my $200 back.
Look, Celtic was supposed to be a lock to win, okay?
Just help a guy out.
That's not our problem.
Actually, it is your problem.
Tie him up, Tuko.
Mind these two.
Stay down!
That'll be that now.
There he is!
Stop!
Go!
Isn't this Isaac Mendez's loft?
The painter.
It was.
Until Sylar killed him.
He was murdered?
Every space has some unhappiness in its past.
The company recently poured a lot of money into outfitting this laboratory.
Everything state of the art.
Well, lucky timing for me then.
Mohinder, it was built for you.
I'm sorry.
You don't realize how valued you are here at the company.
Our people have been instructed to keep a close watch on you.
To anticipate your every need.
That is very generous of you.
But really, I prefer to work on my own.
Supervision is in your best interest...
and in ours.
You're part of the family now.
You're sure Kensei is coming?
Oh, yes!
Maybe he's been killed.
Or kidnapped.
Not Kensei. He knows you are waiting for him.
You have so much faith in him.
At times...
He seems as if he is two men.
One is a brute.
But the other Kensei...
he is gentle.
Really?
Things'll be better now.
You'll see.
But you have to remember your promise.
No more powers.
I just don't see the point of us having these abilities when we don't even use them.
The point is staying safe.
This is your chance at a normal life...
with normal people.
They wouldn't understand.
I just don't want you to go.
I'll only be gone for awhile.
And you're gonna be staying with family.
It could be fun.
I don't even know them.
I don't know how long I'll be gone.
But I do know that when I get back, we'll be together.
I have to do this.
That's what you always say before you do something bad.
I love you.
Well, welcome to New Orleans.
What is that?
W- wait.
Take me with you.
I have a car.
Oh, jeez.
Look at that.
Gorgeous.
I'd say we earned these.
Damn right.
Hey, drink up.
Slainte.
All right, will the traitor.
Please don't shoot.
This is no joke.
Now give me that damn money or I swear I'll shoot you dead, so I will.
so I was right.
That you were.
Congratulations, Peter.
Peter!
Hold your horses, sweetheart!
Now, about that money.
No way.
Give me the damn money!
Peter.
What the...
What the jeez
What's he doin'?
Peter!
Hiro.
I was worried you wouldn't return.
But you did.
You brought back the scroll.
Now I know that you will get the rest of them up to White Beard's camp.
And even Yaeko loves you.
I can leave now.
Wait.
Wait. You're going?
Yes, I have another life to go to.
My father... Ando...
they're all waiting for me.
But what if I can't do this without you?
Only you can keep me from returning to my heathen ways.
You're like a conscience.
Only I take heed of you.
I almost broke history by coming back here.
If I stay, I risk making it worse.
I don't know what to say, carp.
You've done this grubby soul a great kindness.
I thank you.
- It has been my honor. - No.
No,
it is I who am honored...
to meet the great Takezo Kensei.
Bye, friend.
Kensei!
Kensei!
I made you some breakfast.
I can't make it move.
That cup. I used to be able to make things move with my mind.
Thanks for making breakfast, Michelle, you're a real sport.
I can't freeze anything. I can't move things. What happened to them?
Uh, they must've disappeared with your injuries.
I thought you said you were taking care of me?
I'm sorry. Uh, are you breathing?
No collapsed lung? No infection from the wound?
Everything that I've been working for, everything that I had, it's gone.
Listen, the people I work for, they're gonna make sure you get better.
Your back's already healed. It's just your chest we're worried about.
And when that heals,
you'll be able to re-acquire your powers.
With my help, of course.
You.
How are you gonna help?
You gonna make me some more eggs?
By making it easy.
By making it fun.
I can take you anywhere you want to go.
Paris. London.
How about Japan?
And I can be...
anyone you want me to be.
If your fantasy is exotic...
or more run-of-the-mill.
Or something more familiar, if that's what you're into.
Don't you see? I can help you.
We were meant to do this together.
I under-estimated you.
You really are extraordinary.
Just like me.
You were right.
I am gonna get my abilities back.
Starting with yours.
So this is what you really look like.
So silly trying to be something that you're not.
Well, Michelle or Candice or whoever you are,
it wasn't all for nothing.
Thanks to you...
I'll be going back to Maui now.
London.
Japan.
Japan!
It's not working.
I don't have it.
Your power. What's wrong with me?
Ahh!
Ah, would you quit being such a baby,
Pretty boy?
Peter.
I may not know what you are,
but I know who you are.
You're one of us.
And we have no secrets among family.
Well?
Well what?
This is it.
Your box. Your life.
You gonna open it or what?
What if it's a life I don't want?
When I had Will against the wall,
I could've killed him.
I wanted to.
What if that's who I am?
- But you didn't kill him, did you? - No, that's because of you.
It's not because of me, Peter.
You're a good soul.
I can tell.
What if I open this box and I find otherwise?
Do you like the way you are right now?
Do you like who you are right now?
Well, then maybe for now
just leave it be.
I think yours is cooler.
Any time your parents get annoying,
you can just open the window and take off.
Are you kidding?
You're indestructible.
You can skydive without a parachute.
You could skydive without a plane.
you can eat fire just for kicks.
I feel pain.
I just get over it quickly.
So how would it feel then if I-if I do this?
Ow... It hurts!
What about this then?
What's on your neck?
A couple years ago, when we were living in St. Louis
I was riding my bike to school,
and next thing I knew it was a day later and I was waking up in my bed.
Last thing I remember is
this man stepping out of the bushes calling my name.
What are you talking about? What man?
I don't know who he was.
But I remember the way he looked at me.
Like I was an animal he wanted to trap.
I try to put him out of my head. But sometimes I can see his face.
That guy with the horn-rimmed glasses.
I have another vial.
I'll get started on it right away.
Yeah?
I have to take this outside.
- Where are you? - I just got here.
I'm sitting in your office.
Are you sure you're gonna be able to cure me?
Yes.
And like I said, in exchange,
we're going to want a little something from you.
They're moving the paintings somewhere. There's only a few crates left.
This was a terrible idea. This guy's watching my every move.
I can't do this. I'm in over my head.
I told you you have no reason to worry.
As long as I'm alive, you will be taken care of.
- That's exactly the problem. - What are you talking about?
I'm sending you a Jpeg of a painting I found.
The rest have been shipped off somewhere. It's the last in the series. 8 of 8.
we know how it begins with the death of Kaito Nakamura. But how does it end?
Not well, I'm afraid.
Night, Claire.
Night, Dad.
To be continued...
