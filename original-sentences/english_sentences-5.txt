Previously on Heroes...
I'll only be gone for a while.
this is your chance at a normal life.
Welcome to New Orleans.
Is that pay-per-view?
Micah's some type of genius and rigged the cable.
I'll take everything you got in the register!
You don't realize how valued you are here at the company.
You're part of the family now.
I'm in over my head.
As long as I'm alive, you will be taken care of.
Peter!
This here's everything you had on you when we found you.
Your box or your life.
You gonna open it, or what?
Hiro Nakamura, murdered.
Angela Petrelli, attacked.
This is my dad.
He may be the killer.
I'll find your father.
Molly, what's the apartment number?
- Nine. - Nine.
Good girl. Get out of there right now.
- He sees me. - Get out of there.
Leave me alone!
Molly, please wake up.
when confronted by our worst nightmares,
the choices are few: Fight or flight.
We hope to find the strength to stand against our fears.
But sometimes, despite ourselves, we run.
What if the nightmare gives chase?
Where can we hide then?
Okay, when's she gonna wake up?
I don't know, she's burning up.
All right, we gotta get her to a hospital.
No hospital's equipped to deal with this.
You really think my father did this to her... in her nightmare?
She used her ability to find him for you, and slipped into this.
She was so afraid.
I never should have asked her to look for him.
No, you shouldn't have.
But now you know where he is.
I can't just leave her like this.
You have to.
If your father did something to her,
you need to find out what and how to end it.
You have an address in Philadelphia.
She even saw his door.
I haven't seen the man in 25 years.
Molly faced her worst nightmare for you.
Do the same for her.
Find him.
I'll stay here with her.
I'll do everything I can.
I don't even know what I'm dealing with.
Why was he in that photo?
Angela Petrelli...
She knows him.
You're gonna be okay.
I promise.
I was about to lock up when this guy showed u he-
he pushed his way in, shoved a gun in my face.
Next thing I know he's flying through that glass.
You hit an armed man?
I guess.
Could've been a kick.
I don't know, it all happened so fast.
Is this the guy?
His name is Lonny Stills.
He's a local gangbanger.
He's already hit three other fast food joints in the area this month.
It fits his M.O.
Like I said, it's all a blur.
Look, I know you don't want to be a snitch.
It's dangerous.
But in order for me to get this guy off the street,
I need somebody to step up and I.D. Him.
Be a hero.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
You know, I can't help a neighborhood that won't help itself.
You change your mind, you give me a call.
You closing up already?
It's the middle of the afternoon.
I need a break.
I could get used to this.
Right, a guy who can throw 1, 000 volts out of either hand...
settling for everyday life in a pub in cork.
I'm not sure it suits you.
Why not?
Peter, just because you don't remember your past,
it doesn't mean you don't have one.
Aren't you curious about who you are, or where you come from?
You've seen what I can do.
There's a side of me that I can't control.
Maybe it's best if I don't dig too deep.
I know the kind of man you are.
Even if you don't.
There's only good in you.
And I bet whatever's in that box will tell you the same thing.
Weren't you the one who didn't want me to look in that box?
I only said that because you hadn't kissed me yet.
Now that you have, you done with me?
Gettin' there.
After all, a pretty boy like you,
there's bound to be someone looking for you.
Friends?
A girlfriend?
Let 'em look.
Like I told you, you're not gonna find him in there.
But you're sure it was him?
Yeah.
Found him cuffed inside there a few nights back.
Poor sap.
Didn't know how he got there.
Didn't even know his own name.
Do you know where he is now?
Depends.
Who's askin'?
Just me.
I work for a company interested in keeping him out of trouble.
Peter is a.. dangerous guy.
You don't have to tell me that.
He's in town.
Place called Wandering Rocks pub.
Hey, if he's so dangerous, sweetheart,
why'd they send a little girl like you in all alone?
I can take care of myself.
Bring her back to holding.
What do you think you're doing interrogating my mother without me there?
Relax.
She didn't give me anything.
Of course she didn't give you anything.
These people protect each other.
My mother's not a killer.
I'm not gonna have her sit in jail for a crime she didn't commit.
Neither am I.
That's why I'm going to philadelphia to see my father,
figure this whole thing out.
- Let me come with you. - No!
You're not a cop.
Listen, I'm guessing this isn't official police business.
So if I'm there, it won't really make a difference.
Because officially, neither are you.
You don't understand.
It's molly.
My father did something to her.
She's in trouble.
What do you mean "did something to her"?
Come here.
Did what?
He got inside her head somehow.
I don't know how he did it, but I think it's all connected.
To Kaito.
To your mother.
It could be dangerous.
I can take care of myself.
Listen, I have to do this.
Let me come with you.
Fine.
We can probably get there faster.
You know, 'cause you can, uh...
I'm not a cargo jet, Parkman.
Oh, please.
I need to talk to him.
Alone.
Tell him what you told me.
This American girl...
she's hitting all the boys on the dock,
looking for a certain shipping container.
She say what she wanted?
Yeah.
You.
No worries, boyo.
I think I can help.
This is my problem.
Not given what I just saw between you and my sister.
You care about her, don't you?
Right now, she's the only thing in my life that means something.
Caitlin has a flat up the hill.
Go there and stay until I call you.
I'll take care of your friend.
I could handle this myself.
I don't doubt it.
I've seen what you can do.
But I've got an investment in you now.
Some little blonde's isn't going to scare me off.
Now go on.
And don't be telling caitlin about any of this.
She'll only worry sick.
Monica.
Well?
Well, what?
Well, are you gonna tell me what that was all about?
Uh, I just didn't want some crackhead looking for revenge.
So I said I didn't recognize him.
No, not that.
I'm talking about the whole flying-karate-kick thing.
Oh... that.
Mr. Lamont said he has never seen anything like it.
How did you do that?
More importantly, why did you do that?
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.
Nothing makes any sense.
Well...
where did you learn how to...
I think... I think on tv.
Something is happening to me, Camille.
My body does things before my brain even knows what's happening.
That thing with the tomatoes yesterday.
Now this.
It's like...
Like what?
I was supposed to be somebody, Camille.
The first person in my family to go to college.
Now look at me.
You know what, never mind.
I've been here since last night.
I'm just gonna go home and sleep it off.
Hey, Monica.
Everything's gonna be okay.
- Okay? - Yeah
I hope so.
All right, this is it.
This is where Molly said we'd find him.
What are you planning, exactly?
I'm not sure.
You're not sure?
He traumatized your girl.
Has my mother terrified.
You better get sure.
Get your gun out.
Come on.
Hey...
You okay?
When I was 13, my father ran out on us.
I haven't talked to him.
I haven't seen him.
I've spent half my life thinking about
what I'm gonna say to this guy if I ever got the chance.
And now I can't even knock on the door.
You're welcome.
Parkman, this is not a family reunion.
- I know. - Okay.
He's not your dad today.
He is a suspect.
Get your gun out.
Police! Open up!
Who the hell are you?!
I said who the hell are you?!
Put the gun down and I'll tell you.
Parkman.
Matt?
Oh, my god. W- what are you doing here?
Put the gun down.
Not till you tell me what the hell you're doing here!
- I want to know what you're doing inside Molly Walker's dreams. - Who?
And what do you know about Kaito Nakamura's murder?
And while we're at it, why is Angela Petrelli protecting you?
Wait! What are you, a cop?
Right now I'm not, so you better start talking.
I'm good.
You got it all wrong.
That why you're swinging a shotgun?
Because of that.
On... on the desk.
They're gonna kill me too.
Tell me about Molly Walker.
She's seen this symbol. She's seen you,
and she calls you the nightmare man.
She's looking for me.
Yeah, and she saw you looking back at her, and now she won't wake up.
So whatever you did, undo it now.
Sorry, I'm protecting myself.
Protecting yourself from who?
Which one of her kids are you?
You're the politician, right?
My mother is sitting in jail for Kaito's murder.
They both received similar threats.
Both taken from the same picture.
The same photograph.
You were all connected.
Your folks, Kaito...
Linderman, me...
we found each other years ago.
We-we thought we could help people.
Save the world.
The only thing you've ever wanted to save is your own ass.
Still angry, huh, Matt?
Feel better?
Slapping the cuffs on your dad make you feel good?
Oh, it's starting to, yeah.
This is a waste of time.
Just read his mind so we can get the hell out of here.
What did you say?
You can...
read minds?
Yeah?
Go ahead.
Go on.
God!
It's painful, isn't it?
How do you know that?
Can you read minds too?
See, Matt, you and I, we're not so different after all.
Come on, unlock these cuffs.
I'll tell you everything I know.
I promise.
Isn't it wonderful?
We've got a musician in the house again.
Nobody's touched that thing since my mother died.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Nana said I could, but if-
Oh, yeah.
It's okay.
Please keep playing.
You must really miss your mom.
Yeah, I do.
I miss mine too.
Oh, I'm sure she's fine.
And missing you right back.
She wouldn't even tell me where she was going.
You gotta remember she cares about you.
I know new things can be scary.
My mom always said god doesn't give us anything we can't handle.
You play piano too?
No.
Never learned.
If you don't play, then what was that?
Yes?
I've been trying to reach you for hours.
Where have you been?
I'm at work. Why?
It's Molly.
She won't wake up, and her vitals are getting worse.
I'm running out of options here.
Take her to the hospital.
And say what?
That she's trapped in a nightmare?
No, I am taking her into the company.
You can't be serious.
These are the people we're fighting against.
Molly won't last. Not like this.
They are the only people who can understand what's happening to her.
Don't do this.
The moment you trust them with what you care about most, they'll have you.
Don't forget whose side you're on.
I'm on her side.
All right, you gotta tell us everything.
Every crime.
Everyone you've ever worked with.
Everything.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry I left you.
It wasn't easy for me.
Don't.
I need to say it.
When I found out I could read minds, it was a temptation, I was weak.
I used people. I was a real scumbag.
You... a cop.
I'm so proud.
You don't get to be proud.
You don't get to be anything.
Just answer the questions.
You said you tried to save the world.
How?
These gifts came out of nowhere.
We just found each other, like we were connected somehow.
We thought we were invincible.
A few of us took that to heart.
They started to do whatever they wanted.
I did what I could to stop them.
Like what?
This thing we can do, you and I.
It only begins at reading minds.
And then it becomes so much more.
More how?
I... I can't explain it.
No, hang on.
I got something I can show you.
'Cause it helped me understand it.
Yeah, I got a bunch of stuff from back then.
It's... it's in here.
Oh, come on.
Matt?
Matt!
Dad?
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, what the hell's going on?
Where am I?
This is impossible.
We saved the city.
Let me out!
It's a mistake.
I'm not supposed to be here.
Yeah, no one's supposed to be here.
Pleasant dreams.
Monica.
I think I know what happened with the piano.
What can I say?
Guess I'm just a musical genius.
Or it's something else.
Look, it's been a hard couple days for me.
In fact, it's been a hard couple years.
So I think I'm just gonna take a nice long nap, and sleep it off.
Monica.
Do you remember last night when I said I was able to rig the Pay-Per-View on the tv?
Yeah.
Well, I lied.
How did- how did you-
I think it runs in the family.
I mean, maybe not exactly like me, but-
My dad could walk through walls.
D.L.?
Yeah.
And my mom...
don't even get me started on my mom.
But I think what's going on with you is more like this.
A comic book?
Yeah.
This is Saint Joan.
She's a muscle mimic.
A what?
A copycat.
Whatever she sees, she can do.
That's just like what you did with me and the piano.
A copycat.
Copycat.
Look at this.
I shouldn't know how to do this.
I saw it on tv.
Oh, my god.
So if this is really happening to you, maybe we ought to go test it out.
I didn't know where else to go.
Oh, you made the right choice.
We're going to do everything we can for Molly.
In the meantime, we have someone else who needs us.
And we would like you to bring her in.
You're sending me into the field?
Yes.
Molly needs me here.
No, no, no. Molly is our top priority here,
but we need you out there doing the good work you do, helping others like her.
And, uh, you're gonna need this.
This is how you help people?
By tasering them?
Well, that's just standard procedure to make sure everyone's safe.
A lot of the people we encounter aren't in control of their abilities.
But trust me, it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.
Niki's loose, grab her!
Down the hall.
Grab her.
Niki?
What the hell is going on here?
So do you want to try something really rad?
Like a kick flip?
Slam dunk?
Well...
I always sucked at double dutch.
You want somethin', lady?
Yeah. I want to jump in.
And don't call me lady.
It's not much.
I sleep in a pub, remember?
You paint?
Well, it's what I do to relax.
These are amazing.
You're talented.
Is that why you kidnapped me?
So you could sort through me things?
Don't start liking me less now that you're peeling away the mystery.
I just...
wanted to see where you lived.
Lie on a real bed maybe.
No one's stopping you.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Then what is it that's on your mind?
You were right.
Whatever I was, whoever I am...
I have to face it.
Nothing that I find in this box is gonna change anything.
Whatever my life was before, this is where I want to be now.
With you.
Okay?
Okay.
Get on with it then.
Peter Petrelli?
I'm from New York.
Looks like you were leaving.
Th this is an open ticket, New York to Montreal.
Who's that?
I wish I knew.
None of this tells me how I got here.
What I'm supposed to do.
What is it?
Peter?
Oh, my god, Peter!
You know, I've never been in an Irish pub before.
Do you have Haggis?
That's Scotland, love.
We have stew.
And muscles.
And stew.
But I'm closing up.
Oh, well...
yeah, I was hoping you could help me.
I'm looking for a guy.
Best time for that's right after a football match.
The fellas are locked out of their minds.
Up for anything.
His name is Peter Petrelli.
Never seen him before.
Never seen him before?
No.
Cool. Thanks.
The thing is, I talked to a few people from the docks.
They said they saw him in here.
I don't know what to tell you.
So either you're lying, or all those other people are lying.
It's just kinda hard to tell who's lying, you know?
Like I said...
I don't know this Peter.
That it now?
I guess so.
Sorry I couldn't be more help.
Yeah.
So am I.
You gave us quite a scare.
I'm sorry about earlier.
I'm feeling much better now.
Thank you.
We knew it wouldn't be easy.
Multiple-personality disorder is a terrible affliction,
but we're gonna get you well again.
I promise.
Thank you.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I can't leave.
Niki, you're a prisoner.
I'm not.
I came here on my own.
I gave up my son to be here.
I'm sick.
I didn't think anyone could ever understand my problems.
What I've done.
What I'm capable of.
These are the only people that can help me.
Nathan.
Peter?
Peter!
Peter, I knew it.
I knew you could survive
You.
You can't run from me, Nathan.
Baby.
Hey, you've gotta get this baby out of here!
Hey!
Janice?
What are you doing in here?
Is that-
Janice...
is that baby mine?
You said I wasn't the father.
But you read minds.
You looked into my head and you saw the truth, but you still left.
No.
No, I didn't. I didn't know.
You left him.
Just like your father left you.
Just like you're gonna leave Molly.
No.
No, Janice.
Janice! Hey-
You're no hero.
Everybody's dead because of you.
We have to stop it.
You can't.
You don't want redemption.
You want ignorance.
Let's go over the edge.
You won't feel anything.
You never do.
You don't know me.
I am you.
Stop it, Nathan!
Nathan, wake up!
Nathan... wake up. Nathan, wake up!
Nathan, Wake up!
What happened?
Now we know why Molly calls him the "Nightmare man".
You stopped it.
How'd you do that?
I don't know.
Oh, he's gone.
What are you looking for?
We need to know where he went.
Why he's doing this.
Something to-
to what?
I knew this was a con.
I knew I couldn't trust him.
I think I know where he's headed.
That's Bob.
He's one of them.
He runs the company.
Not for long.
Looks like he's next.
According to the map, White Beard's camp should be right over this ridge.
we should leave Yaeko here then.
Right after we defeat his entire army.
That is amazing.
Yeah.
I know.
But what do you think it all means?
Having these- these powers.
I think it means that we're special.
But why?
I mean, all this time I've been praying to god to give me direction.
To show me what I'm supposed to do with my life.
Of all the things he could give to me...
Maybe we're supposed to do something with these.
I just wish I knew what.
It is way past your bedtime.
Hey, this is our little secret.
Right?
All right.
I know it's scary at first, but this is a good thing.
I promise.
I'm just looking for some answers.
That's all.
Monica Dawson?
Yes.
I'm Dr. Mohinder Suresh.
May I?
Can I help you?
I'm sure you have lots of questions about what's happening to you.
Well, I have some answers.
Hi.
Yep.
I'm fine.
Weather could be better.
No, not yet, but I will.
He's here.
Had to improvise a little, but..
No, I mean, I just had to use a little...
persuasion, that's all.
For- no, it was just some guy.
And- all right, I killed him, okay?
What is the big deal?
What do you mean?
Now?
This is my assignment.
And I almost have him.
What if I promise not to-
Fine.
I'll come home now.
Sorry, daddy.
It won't happen again.
What happened?
I don't know.
Apparently you're a genius of an artist too.
I painted that? How?
How do you shoot lightning from your hands?
All I know is your eyes went dead, and you couldn't be stopped.
Until there was this.
Is that us?
I don't know, maybe.
What do you think this is?
A church?
The street signs are in french.
Could be Montreal.
Like the plane ticket.
Hello?
What?
Ricky? Ricky!
Oh, my god, Ricky!
Ricky!
Look at me. Look at me.
Hey, this is my fault.
Okay, they were looking for me.
No, no, no, no...
I'm gonna find 'em, okay?
I'm gonna find 'em.
I can't hide anymore.
I can't hide.
