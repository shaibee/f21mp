HEROES 201- "FOUR MONTHS LATER... "
The sun rises on a new dawn. 
Yet few of us realize the debt we owe to those responsible for this. 
To those who dwell among us,
anonymous,
seemingly ordinary,
whom destiny brought together to repair, to heal,
to save us from ourselves. 
If evolution can do this for even the smallest of creatures,
then why not these human beings?
If someone here... found out about me, what would happen?
- When will they stop? - I don't know.
She's a shiny new toy, and she's all mine.
And they're still out there, among us, in the shadows, in the light. 
We pass them on the street without a glance,
never suspecting, never knowing. 
Do they even know yet?
That they are bound together by a common purpose,
a glaring reality,
to be extraordinary?
Teleportation, tissue generation, these are no longer simply theories.
I have seen them with my own eyes.
And when destiny does anoint them... 
My name is Hiro Nakamura. I'm from the future.
How do they hide from it?
You may feel confined here,
but this is far freer a cage than the one they'd put you in.
How long can they dwell in the shadows before either fate
or their own flawed humanity
draws them out into the light again?
And how will they know what awaits them when it finally does?
CHAPTER ONE - "FOUR MONTHS LATER... "
And not only are these special individuals among us,
they bear a curse.
A virus which strips them of their powers
and leads to their eventual death.
In the last few months, I've discovered what I believe to be a plague.
A plague which targets only these unique individuals.
It's a disease which threatens to eradicate them all. And in doing so,
deprives our species of its evolutionary advancement.
Without this advancement, the challenges of the modern world:
global warming, terrorism, diminishing resources,
seem almost insurmountable on our thin shoulders.
The fate of humanity itself hangs in the balance.
But with proper funding and research,
we can stop the advancement of this disease.
I urge each and every one of you to take up this cause, spread the word,
and fight those who would keep the world from the truth.
Thank you all for coming.
Inspirational lecture, Dr. Suresh.
I was wondering if i could trouble you for an autograph.
Your father would've been so proud.
So would your sister.
Who the hell are you and why are you following me?
This isn't necessary. I'm nobody.
What, you think I didn't recognize you? You've been at three of my lectures.
The company sent you to bag and tag me? Is that it?
A year ago, I would've run, but not anymore!
Well, that's good, because if you had, I wouldn't be able to offer you a job.
I've been down that road before. It doesn't end well.
Where will you go, Dr. Suresh?
No one even believes they exist.
I found your father's book in the parapsychology section
in-between hypnosis and alien abductions.
They don't take you seriously.
They all think you're nuts.
But not me.
So if you're really interested in saving the world,
The least you can do is let me buy you a drink.
Are they really gone?
For now.
We've got to keep going.
We've been running for eight hundred miles.
- I can't run anymore. - We have no choice.
What if we don't make it?
If we get caught, people could die.
They'll die if we don't run.
By tuesday we'll be in America.
There, we can find the answers we need.
Besides, I promised Mom that I wouldn't let you slow down.
All the electives I wanted filled up last semester.
Come on. It's your first day. You should be excited. I am.
Well, it's easy for you to say.
You're not wading into the shark-infested waters of 11th grade.
I don't have one friend. I am shark bait.
You're gonna do fine.
They don't look any different from the kids in Texas.
Okay, except for her. So maybe they're a little bit more...
sophisticated here, but you're gonna fit right in.
If you say so.
Just remember what we talked about.
I know. I'm Claire Butler. I won't slip up.
It's not just the name. It's everything.
Trust me. The company is still out there.
And they will find us unless we're flawless with our plan.
From now on...
you have to be entirely un-extraordinary.
Right. Don't stand out in any way.
Exactly. Don't raise your hand in class.
And don't even think about trying out for cheerleading.
Come on, dad. That's all behind me.
- Just blend in. Be ordinary, right? - You got it.
You know, we might want to start by you not driving me to school.
It kind of draws attention to me.
And, you know...
don't you think it might be easier on all of us if...
I had my own car?
Your mother and I were going to surprise you on your birthday next month.
but...
My gosh. The rogue?
- Thank you, daddy! - It's yours.
- You're the best dad in the world. - I know.
I know.
It's just...
I just can't help thinking about how many times I've said...
good-bye to you on the first day of school.
I'm so sorry for everything I've put you through.
Hope you know how much I love you.
Sorry.
Not again!
Ready!
The past isn't a very safe place.
Not so safe for you either.
Oh my God!
You are Takezo Kensei!
My hero!
I must save you!
I'm asking one more time.
Come out with your hands up.
Look, I know this sucks, NYPD showing up at your door like this.
I get it. But this is what happens when you take somebody hostage.
I just need to make sure everybody gets out of there safely, okay?
Both of you, hands up.
No, I'm the hostage! Shoot her. No, I'm the hostage!
I'm the hostage! Shoot her! I'm the hostage! No, shoot him!
Shoot him. Shoot her.
Shoot her! Shoot her!
Dude, it's her. Shoot her. 
Shoot her. Shoot her!
How did you know?
Okay, guys. good job. 
Let's clean this place up. 
All guns to the armory. 
How did you know which one to shoot?
I don't know. Tone of voice. Eye contact.
The hostage looked me in the eye. The other was looking for an exit.
Well, most people notice a gun under the bad guy's shirt.
Right. Yeah, that too. Of course.
You know, guys who get shot like you did,
they just take that worker's comp and call it a day.
I've been, uh, I've wanted to be a cop my whole life.
Four bullets to the chest aren't gonna change that.
Well, we were gonna drag this out, make you sweat.
But i figured, what's the point?
Take that off.
I figured that,
you'd rather have a real one.
- Well, you gonna take it? - Yeah.
Turn on your bunsen burners, people,
and be careful.
You got a death wish?
You talking about that?
I was just seeing how hot it was.
Pretty sure it's hot. It's called a "flame. "
Yeah. I was just kidding around.
Like you were this morning,
when you stepped in front of my car?
That's okay. Made my morning interesting.
- I'm West. - Claire.
You're new, right?
So what are you?
Meaning what, exactly?
Meaning are you one of them...
or one of the others?
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Well, let me break it down for you. Are you a robot
or an alien?
Cause everyone in the world is one or the other.
Robots do what they're told. stick with the herd.
Aliens, on the other hand, do their own thing.
Well, I don't know. Do I have to choose?
Most people do.
So what are you?
Okay, everyone. 
In the struggle for survival,
it is the fittest who win out
at the expense of their rivals.
Now who said this?
Come on, people. 
Journey of the beagle. 
Evolution.
Anyone?
Charles Darwin.
It's Charles Darwin. 
Easy one. 
Looks like my lucky day.
How much?
Ten thousand Lempiras...
I'll take you as far as Sonora.
That's six hundred miles from the American border.
Okay.
You two married?
She's my sister.
Even better.
You can ride with me up front.
In your dreams.
Ride with me or you don't ride at all.
She stays with me.
We'll ride in back.
You are late.
Oo, I believe I'm right on time.
I believe that your watch is slow.
- Guess what? - What?
Max Grossman tried to kiss me today.
- What? - Mr. Parkman?
- Yeah. - Can I speak you for a minute?
- Sure. Can you give us a second? - Sure.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm just a little concerned, that's all.
Molly's been falling asleep in class the last week or so.
and when I asked her about it,
she said she's been having some nightmares.
She's got kind of a big imagination.
and I realize that there's really nothing I can do about them,
so I'm just trying to make her feel as safe as possible.
About that, I know it's not exactly my place, but...
your situation isn't the most stable.
- My situation? - Your injuries. Your divorce.
Look, uh, my divorce is my business.
And all you really need to know is that molly is loved
and well-cared for and she's doing great.
- She's struggling, Mr. Parkman. - What?
Why, because she's having a few nightmares?
Because of these.
She started drawing them a week or so ago.
Every day, they get a little worse.
Oh, my God.
And I have to ask you,
what is this?
It's in every single picture.
Excuse me.
Sir, with no disrespect to you or Hiro...
it's been almost four months... and there's been no sign of him.
Maybe he's not coming back.
For close to thirty years...
I have seen my son as a disappointment.
A dreamer who excelled at nothing.
It was not until Hiro began this quest...
that I saw his strenght, courage and wisdom.
There is a legacy...
that I am meant to hand down to him.
I will wait for Hiro to return.
I am a man of patience.
This can't be.
Where did you get this newspaper?
From your office.
Sir, what is it?
What does it mean?
In twenty-four hours...
I'll be dead.
What are you doing here, ma?
It's time to move on, Nathan, he's dead.
You don't know that.
Leave his stuff alone. He's gonna want it when he gets back.
You're drunk.
Thank god your father isn't here to see you.
Or you, for that matter.
You killed your brother. Drove Heidi away. Drove your kids away.
If you'd followed our plan. If you'd done what you were supposed to do,
he would be alive now.
To think I almost listened to you.
Yore evil, ma.
Get out.
I did it!
What happened?
How did we get here?
I brought you here.
They were about to put holes in you.
Fifty ryo is not worth dying for.
You can tell Takezo Kensei... he can keep his damn money.
But if you're not Takezo Kensei...
Then who is...
What did you do?
You made him run away!
What did you do?
Why did you make them scatter?
If I put an arrow through that leader's heart.
I would've been a very rich man.
Takezo Kensei?
What are you? Some sort of monk?
You dress so strangely for a monk.
And you wear glasses like a doctor.
I'm not a monk.
I'm your biggest fan.
I know all about you, Takezo Kensei.
I know all the stories about you!
I stole your sword!
You are the hero Kensei?
My name here is Kensei.
But no one's ever called me a hero before.
Can you excuse me?
You were late.
It's my daughter's first day of high school.
- Had to make sure she was okay. - And that's, uh, somehow my problem?
That shipment of toner cartridges
- came in last night. - I know. I was here.
And when exactly were they going to get installed?
Cause I don't see anybody else here doing it.
I'm gonna do it this morning.
And if i wasn't here
watching your every move?
You know, you've been here for a few months, Butler.
I think it's time I saw some commitment to excellence from you.
When I was assistant manager,
We were fully set before the first customer walked through that door.
That is how I got this.
Paper business is dog eat dog.
You gotta live it and breathe it.
You gotta want it. Do you want it, Butler?
Do you?
Yes, sir.
Well, we'll see.
The company was formed 30 years ago with a group of like-minded individuals,
ordinary men and women who were gifted with extraordinary powers.
They wanted to help their own.
To find them and to protect them.
We find people,
and we make sure they don't become dangerous.
Now sometimes that can mean making sure they understand
entirely what they're capable of.
And teaching them to use their abilities for the good of mankind.
And sometimes it can mean
eliminating them.
Who the hell are you to judge who lives and who dies?
If i'm not mistaken,
you yourself tried to put a bullet in the brain of a man named Sylar.
- He was a monster. - Yes.
And you were willing to kill him for the greater good.
You acted on a moral imperative to protect your species.
It doesn't matter one way or the other about Sylar.
He's no longer a threat. He's dead.
And now you have Molly.
You and Matt Parkman are protecting her.
Now we're not interfering with that arrangement.
We offerent to help you.
We have resources to offer you, Dr. Suresh.
The plague. You talked about the disease which killed your sister, Shanti.
- The virus. - Yes.
We have the funds you need for your research.
Now, can you imagine what would happen
if that virus mutated
and crossed over into the general population?
Look, the type of research you're talking about is extremely expensive.
Trust me. That won't be a problem.
Let's just say we have our own private fort knox.
So can we count you in?
- Thank you. - You're welcome. 
Dinner!
Shouldn't I be eating some vegetables every once in awhile?
Well, that is why I got you a vegetable pizza, smarty-pants.
Plus I got your favorite rocky road for desert.
You're just trying to bribe me 'cause you never cook.
- I miss mohinder. He cooks. - Hey, I can cook.
I just thought why not order pizza? Give us time to talk.
Talk about what? This?
Does that mean you passed your detective's exam?
With flying colors. Why? You proud of me?
Depends. Did you cheat?
Why would you ask me that?
Reading the answers out of people's minds, it's unfair.
No, it is my natural talent.
You wouldn't think a baseball player's cheating cause he's athletic, would you?
It's not the same and you know it.
You know what,
I want to talk to you about these drawings that you made at school.
- You're changing the subject. - Ms. Gerber's concerned and so am I.
You don't want to talk about your exams, i don't want to talk about dreams.
I want to help you.
- I don't want you to be- - I said I didn't want to talk about it!
Can I finish my dinner in my room?
Sure. Go ahead.
This book is incredible, Alejandro.
- This man has figured it all out. - Yes.
if he knows the cause, there has to be a cure.
Yes, it's just that. God would not have done this to me...
without a chance for salvation.
Maya, it's not your fault.
You have to believe that.
You keep saying that...
but your words don't make it any easier, Alejandro.
Especially when I know what can happen.
Nothing will happen.
Not when I'm with you. I won't let it happen.
Why did we stop?
You guys.
Come with me.
Just stay here.
What's the problem?
Our financial arrangement... Did I say ten thousand Lempiras?
What I meant to say was...
ten thousand...
for each of you.
I remenber it was for both of us.
Pardon me. I made a mistake.
What I meant was...
that you ride in the back...
and your sister rides up front with me.
I told you she stays with me.
That's it... the deal, take it or leave it.
You son of a bitch.
You don't understand... for God's sake!
You're making a mistake!
Nice move, ballerina. How's that floor taste?
Are you okay?
Don't listen to them. I'm going to go find the birdie thing.
- Thank you. - No problem.
Robot.
- So I'm a robot now, huh? - Far as I can tell.
Okay. Birdie, please.
You don't even know me.
You had the answer today in class, but you didn't say it.
You don't want people to know that you are smart.
You just have me all figured out, huh?
Know a robot when I see one.
Come on, Martha. It's just a back flip off the tower.
And you know the girls will catch you.
Just leave her alone, okay?
Okay, one- don't know you.
And two- as captain of the cheerleading squad,
it's totally within my rights to recruit talent where i see it.
I think martha here has what it takes to be a cheerleader.
So you can do a back tuck off the tower?
What's the big deal?
If it's so easy, why don't you try it?
In fact, if you can do a back tuck off the tower,
Martha here is off the hook.
All right. I'll do it.
This should be good.
We're waiting.
You're right.
Can't do it.
There's a shocker.
Help me!
Help me!
Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. 
I can see you. 
It's okay. It's okay.
It's all right. It was just a dream.
- It was just a dream. - My gosh, can see me.
Did you see him? See what he look like?
Okay, you tell me where he is and I will take care of him.
He's too dangerous.
If I tell you where he is,
he'll kill you too.
Nobody's going to kill anyone. I promise.
I promise. I'm right here.
Don't go, please.
Why are you still here?
You're still on your break.
Yes, I am.
You were supposed to be back on the floor five minutes ago.
There's a line of customers out there.
Just finishing my coffee.
No, you're finished. Get out there.
Just a few more sips, that's all.
You look at me when I talk to you.
Do you hear me?
I hear you all right.
Now you hear me.
I am done eating your crap.
From now on, I will work how and when I feel like it.
I will take breaks when I want to.
And you will not say a damn word to me ever again.
Do you understand?
Square on that?
I don't understand.
Takezo Kensei, the legendary Samurai master...
my father read me tales of...
is a gaijin?
I have to pee.
Are you sure you're Takezo Kensei?
Good name, eh? "Kensei"... means "Sword Saint. "
Men think twice before they trifle with that.
I trought of it when I got here from England.
You are english?
And there's a surprise.
You know, there's very few locals here with whom I can speak plain.
Thank god for you, young man. Sorry. sorry.
So I came over on one of the few trade vessels your emperor let pass.
The boat left full of tea, I kept on to find my fortune.
You should see what I got paid to fend off those bandits.
Kensei Takezo does not fight for money. He fights for honor.
Really? Well, as long as it's honor I can spend.
It's not a bad lot.
I mean, I find a stout brute, put him on a horse, put him in a field,
and tell him to shout on about how he's fearsome old Kensei.
Then I repair to the branch of a tree
and start to pick off the black guards one by one.
- That's fighting dirty! - That's fighting smart, sir.
What? I give him a fair wage.
If he lives.
This can't be.
I come from the future. Many years from now.
Your noble deeds become part of our history.
- The future? - Yes.
- That's a good one. - No, it is true.
I know what happens to you.
As a boy i read the book "The trials of Takezo Kensei. "
How you killed the black bear of Sakashita,
Your love of the swordsmith's daughter,
and you defeat the terrible white bearded warlord
and save the village of Otsu.
- Otsu? - You smell smoke?
What village is that?
That would be Otsu.
Sire, will you tell me what this is about?
I am going to die.
This message is clear.
Who is it from?
I don't know.
Could be any of them.
Them?
All of them...
are very powerful.
You have been a loyal and trusted friend.
I want you to leave.
it's not safe here with me.
I cannot.
I cannot desert you now.
It is for Hiro that I will stay and help you fight.
Very well...
If we are going to fight, then I will need a sword.
Can you find me one?
I'll be back as soon as I can.
It's okay.
Let me see it.
- I do not take death threats idly. - Someone's playing a trick.
Are they?
Charles Deveaux.
Linderman. Your husband.
All of them.
Dead.
Now...
there are nine.
So you think one of us sent these?
For the pain we cause. The people we have killed.
There is no end to our suffering.
I sought redemption
by helping Hiro fulfill his destiny to save the world.
How did you help your son?
I am leaving for Japan tonight.
I suggest you disappear as well.
What happened here?
Bandits. They took everthing.
Is there no God to protect us?
- I broke history. - Villages burn.
- Those things happen. - But not like this!
The future may not exist as I know it.
No future. No cars. No Ando. No me. Great scott.
You mustn't fret everything, my very strange little friend.
Here, have some sake. it'll brighten your day.
No, forget sake! You're supposed to be a hero.
Being a hero never filled anyone's sack with salt and saffron.
It's a waste of time, huh?
In the stories, you are rewarded with more gold than the emperor.
And you took the swordsmith's daughter,
the most beautiful woman in all Japan for your princess.
We gave you everything we had to defend us.
Now our homes are burned.
Thos bandits took my father hostage.
And you sit here drinking?
No need for everyone's day to be ruined.
You swore to challenge them in battle.
I did, Yaeko. But this man got in the way.
- My sword! - My sword!
It's my father's sword.
He forget it. He gave it to you as payment for your protection.
She's the swordsmith's daughter?
and I don't think she wants to be my princess.
Wait!
Swordsmith's daughter!
- Where are you going? - Someone must rescue my father.
If Kensei will not... I will!
Wait! Don't leave!
You have to rescue the swordsmith
and make the daughter fall in love with you.
You have to become the legendary Japanese hero
that you're destined to be.
You have to fight black bear. You have to fight the 11-
The only thing I have to do
is find me a drink.
Come on.
This is going to be tough.
86 straight days of sunshine. You just can't beat that.
Right, Lyle?
I don't know. I guess.
So, Claire,
Lyle was saying that his first day of school was uneventful.
How about you? Anything special happen?
No, nothing.
I, uh, skated by unnoticed.
I was like I wasn't even there.
That's good, honey.
And how about you, sweetheart?
Me?
Anything interesting happen today at Copy Kingdom?
I made a calendar for...
some grandparents. And a coworker brought in donuts.
That's great.
I just think it's amazing how well we have all adjusted to our new lives here.
It's inspirational, really.
The bennets were given lemons and what did we make?
- Uh, Lemonade? - Exactly.
I'll second that.
We're all flourishing really, all except Mr. Muggles.
No one has any idea you won
two regional championships, five all-breed rallies.
Poor little guy.
I mean, how do you go back to the farm after you have seen
gay paris?
n'est-ce pas? mais oui. 
Thank you.
Must be work.
'Scuse me.
'Scuse me.
- Well? - They finally took the bait. 
They caught up with me in Cairo.
- I'm in. - Good. 
It's all falling into place. Just...
Just stay careful. Watch your back. 
And you and I will bring this whole company down.
What did I do... what did I do?
I didn't want to do it.
I know you didn't.
My God...
My God, what have I done?
We have to go.
We have to get to the United States...
to New York.
That doctor is the only one that can help you.
Come... Maya, listen to me.
Give me your hand, let's go.
And the others?
We'll go to where it's safe...
and that's where we'll bury them. Let's go, let's go.
Why are you calling me?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
Well, don't do it again.
- I gotta go. - No, wait. 
Listen, I know why you're going this.
I get it. I miss him too.
I just... I need someone to talk to.
I don't know I can do this anymore.
Do what?
Not be who I really am. And I know that I...
I can't be who they want me to be. And I just feel like I'm gonna burst.
Look, I know you're looking for answers. We all are.
But trust me, I am not the guy...
to give 'em to you.
I'm sorry. 
All of them,
I never expected it would be you.
Sir... I have it.
Sir!
Sir!
What are you trying to do? Kill the poor bastard?
Sorry.
Drag him someplace where he'll stay dry.
And make sure he's breathing, for the love of pete.
Right you are, boss.
We're looking for 9-1-0-9.
The numbers are on the side here.
Supposed to be the third row back.
Hey, boss! Over there!
I figured I'd keep a case for meself.
What are you gonna do with a dozen iPods?
You can barely use a computer. Ah, what do you know?
What the hell?
Maybe we got the wrong number.
No, the number's right. something else is wrong.
What'shat?
What the hell are you doing here?
Where are the iPods?
You heard the man. How'd yous get in here?
Maybe this will jog your memory.
What the hell was that?
Who the hell are you?
I said, "who are you?"
What's your name?
I don't know.
I don't know.
