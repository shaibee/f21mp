Previously on Heroes...
There were 12 of us.
Now... there are 9.
Who wants revenge, Mrs. Petrelli?
I want my lawyer now.
Where is she?
It's gonna be all right, ma.
So you can find anyone in the world?
You just need to think about them?
There's only one that I can't.
When I think about him, he can see me.
Everything that I had, it's gone.
Wait. Take me with you. 
I have a car.
I'll only be gone for a while.
And you're gonna be staying with family.
It could be fun.
Okay, fine. I'm a freak, all right?
Claire, shut up.
What's on your neck?
Last thing I remember,
this man stepping out of the bushes calling my name.
What are you talking about? What man?
The guy with the horn-rimmed glasses.
I'm sending you a jpeg of a painting I found. 
It's the last in the series. Eight of eight.
Mr. Muggles and i just did
two whole miles at the beach.
You wouldn't know it looking at him, 
but this dog can power walk. 
Have you talked to claire lately?
About what?
Oh, just about how she's adjusting.
Has she met somebody? A boy maybe?
If the wrong person comes into her life,
it could be...
problematic for all of us.
What makes you so sure it's a boy?
What makes you so sure it isn't?
Is there something on my face?
Claire, your mother and i need to talk to you...
about boys. Oh, please, not the sex talk again.
It was painful enough the first time.
We just want to know if you're seeing anyone.
Why, because dating is forbidden too?
Along with cheerleading and a social life?
Nobody's forbidding anything, claire.
It's just that any outsider
could be a threat to the family.
Dad, believe it or not,
there are people in this world who aren't out to get us.
All we're saying is
if there is a boy,
i'd like to meet him.
We could help you decide
whether this is somebody that you could trust.
Dad, relax.
Okay, there's no boy.
Okay, it's okay.
I'm sorry, I can't help it. It just keeps on happening.
I'm sorry. Shh. It's okay. Get the light.
Oh, honey.
Molly. 
She's fine, she's fine. Okay, put your head down.
It's over right? Okay.
You want something to drink?
Water.
Water, okay.
It's getting worse. Two a night now.
I'm trying to listen in. Get in her head.
And I keep getting thrown back.
So what are we supposed to do?
I don't know. You're the scientist.
That doesn't exactly make me an expert on nightmares.
That makes two of us.
I don't know. I'll go get the water.
Just keep her calm. And we'll just...
figure it out, right?
Just try to get some sleep, sweetheart.
When will they stop?
I don't know.
Come on, kids, let's go. 
Monty! Simon!
- Dad! - Dad!
Dad!
Hey, boys.
You grew a beard.
You like it?
No?
You want me to shave it?
Listen, I wanted to tell you
that your grandmother is in the hospital.
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.
When you get home,
i want you to get your mommy to help you call her, okay?
Because I know she's gonna want to hear from you.
Okay.
I know I haven't been around.
And i'm sorry about that.
But i'm coming home.
I promise.
And what do Petrellis do when they makes promises?
Keep them!
That's right.
Can I help you?
I'm their father.
You know you're not allowed to be here.
Go ahead.
No, I want to stay with you.
It's okay. Go on.
See you soon, okay?
Mm-hmm. Go ahead.
So... you are from California?
California?
Uh-huh. 
The license on the car. It says "California".
Oh, that.
No, I just picked the car up there.
I'm actually from Jersey.
This is very, very close to New York.
We are going to New York, my brother and me.
Look, I can take you guys pretty far,
but when we get to the border,
chances are they're gonna be looking for all of us.
Dude looks dead.
Help me...
Heroes Season 02 Episode 04 " The Kindness of Strangers"
Micah!
Wake up, fool!
Morning, boys. You ready for school?
Yes, ma'am.
You watch your tongue, young man.
He's a guest in our house.
We'll see about that.
Nana, I need $65.
That's funny. So do i.
Good morning, everybody!
Well, do I look any different today?
Just as lame as you always do.
You look confident.
Confident's good. 
How about in charge? Micah?
Yeah, you look like someone who's in charge.
And why do I look like someone who is in charge?
Because somebody died and left you that way?
No, because today is the day
they're posting the test results
for the Regional Manager training program.
The test I just happened to have aced.
Right.
Good, so now you can afford that $65 I asked you for. 
No, I can't. 
And don't be asking grandma either.
Don't give him a dime, Nana. 
He wants it for some wrestling match
on pay-per-view tonight.
Half the people in this county are living in fema trailers,
and you want to spend good money
to watch grown men jump around in their underwear.
You can walk down Bourbon street for that.
But it's the night of the tag team title. 
I can't miss it.
You should be watching
something educational like this.
This is good tv.
And voila, you have a beautiful tomato rose.
Making flowers out of tomatoes?
Who's got time to do that?
Unfortunately, I do.
And you have a recipe to impress. 
I'll bring dinner home from the restaurant.
- Mwah! - Again?
Wish me luck.
Break a leg.
Whatever.
What you lookin' at?
Nothing.
It's just I think i know a way
to get you pay-per-view.
I did it.
I killed Kaito Nakamura.
Why?
For all the reasons you said.
- Sex? Money? - Yes.
You know I was on the roof.
You have my fingerprints.
I did it. I pushed him off.
When we, uh, we brought you in,
you tried to kill yourself.
Turns out your wounds were self-inflicted.
I was distraught.
Overwhelmed by what I did.
And so I... i attacked myself.
Write down the statement
and let it go, Parkman. 
Please let it go. 
Ahem. Uh...
Mrs. Petrelli, why are you doing this?
My head is clear now. I understand.
The only way out of this is for me to confess.
Fine. 
I'll start the paperwork.
If they keep digging, they will find out
about all of us and what we can do. 
Let it go. 
What's that?
Parental release form
to try out for the cheerleading squad.
For me?
Yep.
I'm flattered.
I don't think I can squeeze cheerleading into my schedule.
But you're kind of a hero to the girls in the squad.
A hero? Why?
The way you stood up to Debbie on your first day.
You know, half of being a cheerleader is having guts.
And you have got those in spades.
I'll tell you what.
I'll think about it, and then i'll let you know
if I change my mind.
Good!
Then take the release form, just in case.
Hi.
Hi.
I can't stop thinking about yesterday.
It was so amazing.
I finally have someone i can be myself with.
Uh, about that.
I... i'm not sure we should hang out anymore.
It's just my parents are really overprotective.
Is this because we flew together?
- I weirded you out, didn't i? - No!
I like you, i really do.
Then it's those marks on my neck, right?
You think I was abducted by aliens.
I told you, it was a guy with horn-rimmed glasses.
It's my dad.
He's just really overprotective
about the dating thing.
Then let me talk to him.
I don't think that's a good idea.
But...
i can fly. And you can regenerate.
I mean, doesn't that tell you anything?
Please don't make this harder on me
than it already is.
Okay. I'll tell you what.
Tomorrow i'll totally back off.
Today, i'm asking you out.
- West... I... - Tonight, anywhere you want to go.
If you want to call it off after that, fine.
Fine, but just this once.
You won't regret it.
What do you think you're doing questioning a suspect
in a hospital?
- Any confession is coerced. - She's sick.
Coerced or not, they believe her.
But I know she's innocent.
How?
The same way I know that you can fly.
I can read your mind.
Just like I read your mother's.
But I can't tell my partner what I know or how I know it.
You reading my mind right now?
No... yes, sorry.
Look, your mother thinks she's protecting somebody
by shutting down this investigation.
But i'm not gonna let it happen.
I'm not backing down.
I've got a little girl at home that wakes up
in the middle of the night screaming about nightmares,
and drawing a symbol that... this.
The same symbol that's on these photos.
I know that symbol.
I think it's all connected.
Everything.
What you and I can do. We're all connected.
I know this photograph.
Good, because I need your help.
I can't continue this investigation without you.
All right, i'll help.
I need five minutes alone with my mother.
Alone.
Why are you confessing to a crime you didn't commit?
Because you were right, Nathan.
I don't deserve to be saved.
Ma, I was angry when I said that.
I was drunk. I didn't mean it.
Of course you did.
You asked me for help once. Now just let me help you.
Just because you shaved
doesn't mean you're clean and sober.
You still have to get yourself into a program.
Get your family back.
Don't let your children hate you.
Not if you can help it.
You didn't kill Kaito Nakamura.
I know that.
I have done so many bad things in my life
it really doesn't matter what crime I confess to.
Let me help you, ma.
No, what you want is redemption,
and you're not gonna get it by helping me.
You'll just get killed.
And I can't bear to lose another son.
Ahem.
He has to do this. I'm sorry.
It's all right. I'm... i'm ready.
Where's your stuff? You're traveling pretty light.
I got robbed.
Been walking for three days. Thank god you came along.
Where are you going?
Going home to America. New York.
New York.
This is where we're going.
Do you have family there?
No.
Uh... we need to find this man.
Maya, no.
Dr. Suresh.
This is a coincidence.
I know this book. I've read it.
Really?
Why are you searching for Dr. Suresh?
For a... how you say this?
- Answers. - To what?
I know Dr. Suresh.
We're old friends. You and Dr. Suresh?
You've helped me. Now I can return the favor.
I can... I can take you to him.
I can help you find him.
Thank you. I don't know what to say.
I don't even know your name.
It's Gabriel.
Gabriel Gray.
Gabriel.
Oh! Like the angel.
Yeah.
Just like the angel.
* I spent oh so many nights *
* just feeling sorry for myself *
* I used to cry... mm mm *
* but now I hold my head up high... *
We've got rules against drinking on the job, you know.
It's all about attitude, Camille.
- What's about attitude? - Life.
And today is the first day of the rest of mine.
Uh-huh, you sound like a fortune cookie.
No, I sound like a woman with a future.
Is there something you're not telling me?
I took the test.
Oh, are you pregnant?
No!
Girl, now how am i gonna be pregnant
wearing this outfit two shifts a day?
The management training program.
I took the test.
Oh, that.
What do you mean "Oh, that"?
Nothing.
I just think that you shouldn't get
your hopes up, that's all.
Only a fool would put money
on a 1 in 50 chance.
Look, if I make manager, i can earn enough money
to go back to school, get my degree.
I can move my family out of here.
It's not right.
One storm comes rolling through here
and blows away my whole life.
My mother. My college education.
My dreams.
I'm sorry.
It's just you've been talking like this
since we were in kindergarten.
One scheme after another, and nothing every happens.
What in the world?
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't...
Monica, let me talk to you for a second.
Okay.
I'm sorry, Monica.
You're just not qualified for the management program.
So I didn't do well on the test?
You did fine. Not top tier, but...
but what?
I'm motivated. I'm hard working.
Mr. Lamont, i've never missed a day.
That's not the issue.
A management position means you need to be available
for any location in the state.
And it's just not right for someone in your situation.
My situation?
Your home life.
Your brother, your grandmother.
That's the point. I'm the breadwinner.
I need the money.
And I mean, I can't make hamburgers
for the rest of my life.
You're good at your job, Monica.
What's wrong with that?
And you should be happy you have one.
There's a lot of people in this city who don't.
I thought for dessert
we could go to that adorable yogurt place
near the bus depot.
I can't.
I have to go to the library for a research paper.
The library?
Haven't you ever heard of the internet?
Actually, the research paper is on libraries
and how during the digital age
they're becoming
increasingly obsolete for our generation.
Do you need a lift?
What?
Your car? It got stolen, remember?
So do you?
That's okay.
I think i'm just gonna walk.
Okay.
Hi.
Hi
Photo's gotta be in here somewhere.
It's a group shot.
Maybe 10, 12 people.
What kind of group is it?
It was a party or a meeting.
My parents are in it. Kaito Nakamura.
You knew Nakamura? No, my folks did.
He used to come over the house sometimes.
My father didn't seem to care for him too much.
I remember the last time I saw him,
my mom hugged him, and it lasted
just a little bit too long.
What about the others in the group?
Linderman was in it.
Charles Deveaux too.
A lot of them are dead now.
These your boys?
Yeah.
What, you don't see 'em that often?
Look, I don't... i'm sorry,
i don't really know you that well.
My wife... my ex-wife, uh, cheated on me.
Which I could've forgiven her for,
except for the fact that she was pregnant
with his baby.
Why are you telling me all this?
I just... I know a bunch of stuff about you.
I figure it's only fair.
If you want to unload, go ahead.
Six months ago, i was a cop in L.A.
Married, expecting a child,
and then all of a sudden this stuff started happening.
It just turned everything upside down.
I'm just looking for answers.
Maybe this'll help.
That's the same photo.
Half the people in this picture are dead.
It's the like killer's
picking 'em off one by one.
Maybe one of these is the killer.
Look, here's my father, 
here's my mother. 
Charles Deveaux. Linderman. 
Kaito Nakamura. This guy's name is Bob. 
Bob... I don't know his last name.
I don't know the rest of the people
in the picture either.
I know him.
How?
That's my father.
Hey. 
Ugh. Making hamburgers?
Is he kidding me?
I swear, i'd like to smack him upside his head.
I'm glad you didn't. You can't afford to get fired.
I can't explain it,
but I know i'm supposed to be somebody.
I feel like there's something inside me
that wants to come out.
Does that make any sense?
You lost more than most in the storm,
and that kind of loss, it takes a while.
You shouldn't be in such a hurry.
I don't know. Maybe god's punishing me.
Now why would he do that?
For being selfish.
I pray for it every Sunday in church.
For god to find me a way out of here.
Everybody else is praying for the community.
To put things back together, to give them strength.
Not me.
I'm just praying for a way out.
That's terrible, isn't it?
Monica, given the situation,
i'd say it's pretty normal.
Normal.
Yeah, that's me all right.
I offer to take you anywhere,
and this is all you can come up with?
Well, what can I say? I'm a cheap date.
You got a thing for heights, huh?
There was this place near where I used to live in Texas.
It was this old gravel tower.
I used to climb up to the top of it.
See what I could do.
You'd jump off?
Yeah.
Guess i've just been thinking a lot about my life.
How it all went away so fast.
Why did it go away?
I can't tell you that.
The truth is so many terrible things
happened to me while I lived there...
i'm not sure I could ever open up to anyone again.
Well, we're here together.
So part of you must want to share something.
I want to trust you.
Then jump.
What?
- Trust begins with a leap. - Oh!
Cheesy, but true.
Oh, no, it'll be gross.
My arms pop out of their sockets
and sometimes my feet come out facing each other.
It's... it's not cute.
Claire, these fears you have
of someone finding out about you,
of feeling different forever,
i have them too.
You can share them with me,
but I can't help you if you don't trust me.
Okay.
You caught me.
Of course I did.
But I would've been fine.
I know you can heal, Claire.
But I never want to see you hurt.
I don't understand.
You don't even have tools.
Just hold on.
Almost got it.
You know if this doesn't work, you're dead.
You know that, right?
Wow, you did it!
All right, you got your stay of execution.
Is that Pay-Per-View?
Uh-huh.
How did you get that?
Turns out Micah's some type of genius
and rigged the cable.
Is that true?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help.
Look, I know it's tough
being stuck with your cousins like this
after everything you've been through.
But I promised your mother that i'd look after you.
So you gotta obey the rules around here, okay?
I know.
I, uh, I got dinner for you guys.
You can eat in front of the tv.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah.
I just wish I could fix your dreams for you.
You're a sweet kid.
Go tell Damon dinner's ready.
Dinner's ready.
Yeah, in a minute.
Here goes a 619.
That's awesome.
Matt, you're home!
Hey, yeah! I'm home.
Oh, and I need to talk to you.
Uh, both of you, actually.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, yeah, i, um...
i have to find my father.
You don't know where your dad is?
He left me when I was 13.
He gave me 120 bucks and a pat on the head.
And you haven't seen him since?
I've tried, but that's the thing about criminals.
They... they don't like to be found.
He's a bad guy?
My dad stole a lot of money from a lot of people.
And the case that i'm working on right now,
i have a feeling that he's in the middle
of something really dangerous,
and I need to talk him.
So I need you to help me find him.
- Okay? - Okay.
All right, good.
There he is. That's my dad.
- Molly, what is it? - Molly, what's wrong?
Put it away! Put it away!
- Molly. - Molly, what's wrong?
Please don't make me look for him.
Please don't make me look.
I don't understand. Why not?
He's the man in my dreams.
He is the nightmare man.
I'm gonna make things right, Pete.
Get away from me!
Oh, my gosh, look what time it is.
My dad's gonna kill me.
What lie did you use to get out of the house?
'Cause i'm guessing you didn't say you were flying around in the arms of some kid from school.
I said I was going to the library.
Ouch.
I'm sure he didn't suspect a thing.
I'm sorry, i'm a lousy liar.
Look...
if we're gonna keep seeing each other,
you've gotta come up with something good.
Something consistent.
Like what? I'm volunteering at a soup kitchen.
Claire, the credible lies
are the ones that make you look bad.
What else is it that your dad doesn't want you to do?
I think I have just the thing.
Aren't you gonna say good night?
You're killing me.
Gabriel.
Come here. Check this out.
There are killers in the car with us.
What?
"Homocidio. " Right there.
Well, golly, they seem so...
Dude, I have been riding with them for two days.
We gotta ditch 'em.
Okay, um...
all right, i'll distract them.
And you... you go call the police.
There's a payphone right inside.
We have a problem.
I'm gonna ask you a question,
and you need to tell me the truth.
What is it?
This. Is this you?
Yes, this is us,
but it is not our fault.
We didn't mean to hurt anyone.
Well, you can tell the police that,
because Derek is calling them right now. 
No, no, no, please, no! He cannot!
Maya!
What are you doing to me?
You both...
have power.
This is not our fault.
We don't know what's happening to us.
That's why you need to find Dr. Suresh.
Yes.
Believe me, I understand what you're going through.
To be held responsible
for things that you didn't mean to do.
Being hunted.
I've helped Suresh with so many people like you.
He'll know what to do.
But the police.
They have to catch us first.
How was the library?
Dad, I can explain.
You don't need to.
You were with a boy.
No, no, there's no boy.
Okay.
So...
i'm waiting.
I tried out for cheerleading.
Cheerleading?
I made the squad.
I forged your signature on the release form.
The girls took me out to celebrate.
You...
first you get your car stolen, now...
I- i told you no cheerleading.
I was very specific about that.
Dad, cheerleading makes me happy, okay?
Look, I know, it's scary and I know there are risks.
Just please let me have this one thing.
I've done everything else you've asked me to.
I've given up my friends and my life.
I just need one thing that's normal.
I had no idea that cheerleading
meant that much to you.
Took me by surprise too.
You're gonna let me do it?
I'll make you a deal.
You cheerlead,
but you promise me
that you will not date
for now.
Okay.
Okay.
I have a lead on the paintings.
We have to go to Odessa.
Texas.
The Ukraine.
It's a long trip.
What will you tell your family?
Oh, i'm sure i'll think of something.
She's finally settling down.
I'm sorry.
You didn't know.
No, i'm sorry, because...
Molly has to find my father.
That is out of the question.
A lot of people in this photo are dead.
This guy, dead. This guy, dead.
Kaito Nakamura, murdered. Angela Petrelli, attacked.
This is my dad. He may already be dead.
He be the next victim. He may be the killer.
I have to find that out.
Look, this man here?
This is the man I work for. His name is Bob.
I'll take you to him.
Fine. After we find my dad.
You leave Molly out of this!
You're asking a little girl
to confront her worst nightmare!
Maybe confronting it is exactly what she needs.
Oh, so this is all about helping Molly?
Because to me it sounds like a 13-year-old boy
trying to make his daddy pay for leaving him.
And you know everything about daddy issues.
Yeah, I do.
I'll do it for you, Matt.
I'll find your father.
Thank you.
Monica, it's dead tonight.
Let's close up. You get the front door.
I'll get the back. Sure.
Sorry, we're closed.
But the sign say y'all close at 10:00.
Look, i'm hungry.
My boss, he's making me close up for the night.
And I said i'm hungry.
And while you're at it,
i'll take everything you got in the register!
Okay okay
Sit down right there!
Did you just see...
Where'd you learn that?
On tv.
We're right here for you.
Yeah, we're gonna protect you.
I see a city.
Philadelphia. Good.
- An apartment building. - What floor?
I don't want to go in.
He can't hurt you. It's okay.
- Third floor. - Okay, good.
Good, what's the apartment number?
He knows i'm here. He's coming.
- Okay, Molly, what's the apartment number? - Quickly, come on.
Nine. Nine, good girl.
All right, get out of there right now.
He sees me, he... leave me alone!
Molly, get out of there! Leave me alone!
Molly, Molly!
Matt.
- Molly? - Molly!
She's breathing. What happened?
She's in shock. She won't wake up.
Come on, Molly, you did it.
Molly, it's time to get up!
- Come on, wake up! - Matt, don't.
Don't.
Matt, help me!
Matt!
