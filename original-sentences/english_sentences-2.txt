Previously, on heroes...
Takezo Kensei?
You're supposed to be a hero!
I don't think she wants to be my princess.
Dr. Suresh... can we count you in?
Finally took the bait.
They caught up with me in cairo.
I'm in.
And you and I will bring this whole company down.
We are all in grave danger.
Our past has caught up with us.
No!
- Claire - I'm west. - Claire.
Are you one of them?
Or one of the others?
I figured that you'd rather have a real one.
We need to talk about the nightmares.
There's nothing you can do.
Molly! I wanna help you.
If we get caught, people could die.
They'll die if we don't run.
What the hell are you doing here?
Who are you?
What's your name?
I don't know.
He's awake.
Where am I?
Home.
You took something that's ours, boy-O.
WANDERING ROCKS PUB CORK, IRELAND
Just tell us where you stashed the ipods.
We'll cut your binds.
You'll be on your way.
As square a deal as you're likely to find.
I didn't take anything.
Right.
With the thousands of shippinaicontners coming through cork harbor every day,
you just happen to be having tea in the onewe were sent to rob.
I don't know how I got in there.
You might wanna consider remembering, boyle.
You're in a bad spot.
CHAPTER TWO "LIZARDS"
BENNET HOUSE COSTAVERDE, CALIFORNIA Ahh, dang it all.
My wedding ring fell in with the eggs.
We do have a colander, dear.
No need to be flashy.
It's no big deal.
It isn't until it gets you noticed.
I can't even be myself at home?
It's bad enough that I have to be all fake at school.
We simply asked you to lay low.
High school doesn't work like that, dad.
You lay low, and you get noticed more tn anyone.
They have metal detectors for people who lay too low.
I have to be someone.
You know I trust you, claire.
I mean, we got you your own car.
You know, it may be easy for you to pretend that you're the most boring photocopier in the world.
But I can't not be what I am.
Whatever that is.
Making copies is not my job.
Keeping this family safe is my job.
And if that means that I don't have time to make you breakfast in the morning
or I have to dress up in this stupid shirt
so that we stay invisible and nobody finds us...
then that's what I'll do.
And I need you to do the same.
I forgot how weird it must be for you to play normal after being... whatever that was.
Don't you feel sorry for your dad.
Compared to the life I had... normal's a pretty nice vacation.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Have a good day.
Did you see this?
Yamagato C.E.O. Dead At Age 70
I knew this would happen. Kaito.
How'd you know this was gonna happen?
Hey.
That's not the way we do things anymore.
No more secrets.
That was the deal.
This was done by a very gifted artist in new york.
Isaac Mendez Isaac mendez.
Everything he's ever painted has come true.
Except for a series of eight.
I was only given the first.
There's seven more.
What's in the other paintings?
I don't know.
But I'm gonna find them.
DEVEAUX ROOFTOP NEW YORK, NY
What, are you waiting on an invitation?
Oh, no.
I've just spent so much time on that side of the tape,
I was just savoring the moment.
Yeah, well, welcome to the big leagues, detective.
Let's hope you survive.
All right, got kaito nakamura.
70, a japanese national.
Ceo of yamagato industries.
Now, he fell out of the sky onto central park west with this in his pocket.
That look familiar?
Uh, no.
No, I've never seen this before.
Well, Mr. Masahashi here is a witness.
He says that he saw Mr. Nakamura being pushed by someone who went over with him.
But we've only got one body.
Well, either the killer fell 20 stories, got up and walked away, or flew away.
You know somebody that can do that?
Ah. We, uh, found a fingerprint on the photo.
Got a match.
Angela petrelli Angela petrelli.
We need to bring her right in.
Mr. Masahashi.
You ever seen this symbol before?
Yes.
It is a kanji.
It means, "great ability, godsend. "
Ability?
It is the crest of takezo kensei, a famous hero in japan.
Mr. Nakamura used to read the kensei stories to his son hiro.
I need to talk to him.
So do I.
OTSU, JAPAN 1671
HAVE YOU SEEN A SCARY WHITE MAN?
You must be sober!
If we don't go after yaeko right now, she'll be killed!
Who's yaeko?
The girl you're supposed to fall in love with!
The one who hates me?
Yes, before I came back in time and ruined everything,
she was supposed to be your princess, and you, a hero.
You look like a fish when you talk.
No, I promise, if you do this, they will tell the story for 400 years... minimum!
Like a giant carp.
I already made a mess of the past.
The space/time continuum can't take any more.
History needs Takezo Kensei to be a hero today...
Ando's never going to believe this one!

Heroes Season 02 Episode 02
This video demonstrates the newt's amazing ability to regrow a completely working limb.
But newts are not the only creatures with this talent.
Thanks to millions of years of combined mutation,
lizards are capable of cellular regeneration.
You mean like people who can heal themselves?
No, not people, claire.
Lizards.
And raise your hand, please.
But it's possible, right?
For people to be able to do that too?
I mean, theoretically.
Well, there's a lot of controversial, though promising, work with stem cells.
So we might be able to culture whole organs and limbs for people who need them?
I guess the next step for us is phasing out the extra parts.
We're not using the appendix anymore, or grinding bone with our wisdom teeth.
We don't even really need a pinky toe for balance.
It's all just... junk in our dna.
I've read that some people might have evolved a different code already.
Is that possible?
I'm afraid you are gonna need an advanced degree in genetics to get at those answers.
And I hope you thank me in your dissertation.
What?
{6}HARTSDALE, NEW YORK
Oh, so how'd you like the jet?
A lot better than flying coach, huh?
I didn't agree to work with you for the comforts.
Still, it doesn't hurt.
I can't help people with abilities unless I have access to all your records and your labs.
Of course, of course.
And right now, I need to get you back on that plane because
- I have your first assignment here somewhere. - Assignment?
I thought you said your company kept its medical samples here.
Not samples.
A man.
In port-au-prince.
He turned up sick.
Weakness, tremors, loss of abilities.
He's dying.
The virus.
If there's another case, there could be some reservoir of infection.
That's what I need you to find out.
To date, there have only been two presentations of the disease.
Your sister in 1974, and molly walker four months ago.
If there is actually a third case...
then it is spreading.
I'll test him.
If it's true, I'll bring him back as soon as possible.
Oh, and, doctor... as of now, your blood is the only cure for that virus.
Try not to get yourself killed.
COATEPEQUE, GUATEMALA 30KM FROM MEXICO
Nidia Nidia
You remember us?
You are all grown up but I still see you as children.
I still remember the day you were born.
Fist Maya, the Alejandro right behind.
I see it is still the same way.
Maya... Maya...
Go ahead and rest.
You will help take us across the river into Mexico?
We have no money.
I can't take money.
This is no place for the young to make their lives.
It's been so long since anyone has been so kind to us, Nidia.
I've forgotten what it means to trust someone.
Others will be coming soon. We have a long night ahead.
Come, you must be tired.
You see? We're almost there.
It's not right to risk her.
We shoule find a way to cross alone
the police know our faces
we have to keep going
but what if it happens again.
I won't let that happen
Bet you were prettier yesterday.
I like your necklace.
What does it mean?
I wish I knew.
Let's try an easier one.
What's your name?
I don't know.
It's not your day, is it?
I'm caitlin.
You know that much now.
Caitlin Caitlin.
What are they gonna do to me?
I don't know.
Whatever my brother thinks is best.
Your brother?
Did he send you in here?
He'd pitch an epic fit.
Thought I'd try a kinder tack.
Thing is, this job, it's bigger than you and a couple of quid.
They pulled it for this man named mcsorely.
Promised delivery today.
So what happens if the guy doesn't get what he wants?
You have to remember something.
Anything... a name, a face.
First thing I remember is your brother and his crew finding me.
Then the big guy came at me and...
and an electrical short blew tuko on his arse...
I heard the story.
The spark.
I think it came from me.
My hand.
- L... I know that it seems- - is it possible?
I've just rung out... a lot of your blood.
You don't have a mark on you.
PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI
Is anyone here?
My name is Monhinder Suresh.
I'm a doctor.
There's a possibility you have a very rare virus.
That's why I've come.
I may be able to help.
Give you a cure.
I do not want your cure.
Without it, you could die.
God gave me power.
I abused his gift, so he took it away.
Now I suffer his judgment.
Then perhaps we should leave it to god to decide.
The chances are you carry one of 100 viruses I can do nothing about.
If you somehow carry this one virus, there is only one cure.
The distillation of my own blood, and I was guided to you.
Surely that's a sign.
Just the same as your suffering.
A sign of what?
That god isn't quite done with you yet.
So, my friend, shall we see if he still offers redemption?
He watches over you.
My brother has always been there to protect me.
From the day we were born.
Twins.
Nidia is helping you cross too?
My sister is not well. We are going to get her medical help.
It must be serious to make such a dangerous journey.
Perhaps I can help.
I am a healer.
We are going to America to find a real doctor
Let me... please
Don't be afraid
It's a new illness
You fear it will spread
You fear... yourself
What you carry inside you is black
Enough to kill the devil
No one can heal you
You are cursed
Keep an eye on him.
If he so much as lays an inconsiderate fart, you grab the gun.
What am I, 12?
Always.
Come on. Come on.
Sorry, fellas.
Ricky and the boys just left.
Aye, I saw.
We're not here for ricky.
Lucky then. I've just tapped a barrel.
Two pints?
No, thanks, love. We came for you.
So... lizards, huh?
Tell me you didn't just time that so I'd walk right past you.
I figured you'd be more into whales or something.
Unicorns.
You know, you make a lot of assumptions.
Is my hair really that blonde?
I think it's cool, actually.
I'm sort of into genetics too.
I didn't say I was into genetics.
You don't have to hide everything interesting about you.
Biology is supposed to be our destiny.
But people forget... genes can change.
I thought guys like you were supposed to sit at the back of the classroom and hate everything.
I just found this book.
It's by some indian guy.
I can barely even pronounce his name.
It's about everything you're talking about.
People who've evolved.
There's a whole chapter on regeneration.
Sorry, I, uh, left all my awesome genetic textbook reading for the summer vacation.
You should see it.
L- I could bring it over.
Get you on your way to your phd.
You know, I don't really care that much.
I was just kind of bored in class.
Really?
Yes, but if you like lizards, that's awesome... have fun.
And I gotta go home.
Where's my car?
Will it?
Kensei?
Your blood is clearing the viral load.
Seems you have this disease after all.
How are your hands?
Steady as faith.
I prayed your cure would not work.
If I prayed, I would have asked the same.
The thought of this virus finding you, out here.
If it spreads...
so you did not believe what you said.
About god sending you to cure me.
I have trouble believing in any god that would allow a pathogenlike this to exist.
It killed my sister.
Seems like it's becoming even more virulent.
With a replication rate this aggressive, you would have been dead by morning.
The people I work with will want me to bring you infor observation.
I have a plane.
You work for people?
A company.
Of course.
There's always a company.
Where is he?
Where is the haitian?
The haitian?
Isn't he in haiti?
We're in haiti.
You've been out of contact for hours.
I was in your office.
You gave me an envelope, said... a man may have the virus.
That I was to cure him.
He wouldn't have been able to take your memory unless the vaccine worked.
So... apparently it did.
Full recovery. Thank you, dr. Suresh.
My memory?
I'm sorry.
Well, at least we've contained the virus.
We'll just chalk this up to a rookie mistake.
BORDER GUATEMALA AND MEXICO
we must go!
But my brother...
Run!
It's too late.
You're crused!
Stay *****stay away!
Hey.
Five-pound bag of gummi bears.
Receptionists love them.
A well-stocked candy dish makes them feel popular.
Dad, if I told you something, will you promise not to freak out?
My car kinda got stolen.
My god, claire.
My heart just about stopped.
I know. What's a stolen car when you're running for your life?
Not that... look, I loved the car, and if you ever got me another one,
I promise I will never leave it unlocked, ever again.
You left it... unlocked?
Claire... I have to be able to trust you.
And not just with the car, with everything.
I know. I made a mistake.
We can't afford mistakes.
'Cause we're in hiding, and it's dangerous.
- That's right. - Oh, great.
I'm in hiding because of something I can do, and I don't even know what that is.
You know enough.
But I don't even know how it works.
Or what my limits are.
I mean, if I cut off my arm, would it reattach itself or would I grow a new one?
We shouldn't be discussing this.
You're the only one I can talk to about this.
I mean, I could be missing my opportunity to help people.
If my skin can grow back after I boil it in with the eggs,
then maybe my blood can help someone who got burned, or... or someone who's sick.
I don't even know if I can get sick.
That's enough, claire!
Look, you can yell at me all you want about the car, but this is what I am!
I have kept you out of danger your whole life so you wouldn't have to find your limits.
Because if they find you, that's what they'll do.
They'll cut you, they'll test you.
And they will push you so far past your capacity for pain that you'll wish you could die.
Believe me.
You may feel confined here, but this is far freer a cage than the one they'd put you in.
I've gotta get back to work.
You and nakamura.
Witness said you had a fight yesterday.
We were old friends.
Sometimes simple conversations can be misconstrued.
Hmm. He said you slapped him.
He made an offhand comment about my son's death.
I found it distasteful.
You're a major shareholder in yamagato industries.
That stock's been in the toilet for months now.
You think I killed kaito over money?
Most common motives are money and sex.
Well, I don't need the money, and I wasn't sleeping with him.
Not for a long time.
You recognize that symbol?
Yes, it's the logo of my husband's law firm.
Why draw it across nakamura's face?
I don't know.
E Because we did something terrible, and now someone wants revenge.
Would anyone want revenge on him, maybe... on you?
Who said anything about revenge?
I want my lawyer now.
Who wants revenge, mrs. Petrelli?
Stand down, parkman. She cried uncle.
Get out of my head!
Mr. Petrelli.
I know you.
Detective matt parkman.
We met in texas when you came in to lawyer your brother out of jail.
Look, I'm sorry about peter.
Follow me. I'll show you to your mother.
She's not gonna want to see me.
Look, I just came to get her out.
Then why'd she ask us to call you?
She doesn't haveanyone else.
That's not possible!
Stand back.
It's gonna be all right, mom.
It's gonna be okay.
Who did this to you, mrs. Petrelli?
Aren't you gonna say anything?
About what?
About those things you did.
I didn't do anything.
Make up a story.
Tell me you lost your memory of tonight too, but don't pretend I'm stupid.
You had to knock the piss out of him, didn't you?
The fella you put through a wall was mcsorely's son.
A sadistic bastard, but his old man loves him.
And you just made him even uglier.
Fine, next time, I'll leave him alone with your sister.
Don't you mouth off to me.
You turned a fixable monetary problem into a blood feud.
Ricky! Ricky!
You're gonna make this right.
We'll do another job.
Something big enough we can drop a fat stack on his desk and get him off our backs.
I'm not a thief.
Maybe not.
But you certainly handled those two like a pro.
And that makes you something.
Now, doesn't it?
What's to say I don't do the same thing to you and walk out of here?
I thought common courtesy would do it.
No?
Then maybe this.
You might want this... peter.
My name is peter?
Sounds about right, doesn't it?
Just something I read.
This here is everything you had on you when we found you.
Credit cards, maybe a train ticket.
Could even be a love letter.
It's all yours... you just have to help us with one little job.
What do you say... peter?
Hello?
Mr. Kensei?
You stole my armor and left me withal.
Who do you think you are?
I only did it to save yaeko.
And to show that takezo kensei is not a drunk, but a hero.
- And I did. - You did?
Yes. They're already telling of your bravery.
And what exactly did I do on this day?
You disarmed 11 men and rescued a beautiful girl.
I'm to believe you did all that and took no credit?
All right, carp, I'm in.
Really?
I don't know what brand of fool you truly are,
but it appears listening to you will grant me more reward.
- And more of her. - It will!
Mm-hmm, then you can make me the hero she sees in me.
As long as you stop drinking.
No promises.
I'm sorry, carp.
Maybe I'll be a hero next time around.
No!
You cannot die!
You're working late.
Night shift. Don't ask.
Was it a productive trip?
You should have the answer to that yourself very shortly.
And you didn't arouse any suspicions?
I don't think so.
Bob seemed more angry at himself for trusting the bungling professor.
They'll be watching me more closely now.
That's to be expected.
Don't worry.
I'll find the other paintings myself.
Are you sure?
You've given me everything I need.
Welcome to copy kingdom.
How can I help you?
Turn that off.
That is salt in the wound for poor Mr. Muggles.
I'm sorry.
That was very inconsiderate of me.
You're right.
It doesn't help to avoid it.
Well... guess it's just you and me.
Come on, grow back.
No way.
