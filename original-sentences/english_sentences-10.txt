Previously on Heroes...
You're going to die! Here! Tonight!
This is my fate then.
I can't save him.
But I can learn who killed him.
Kensei takezo.
When I get back, we'll be together.
You came here to get control of your life.
It's another strain of the virus.
My blood's no longer a cure.
I'm going to die?
Claire is the key
That could cure the virus.
And he has asked you to give us Claire.
You touch my daughter and I'll kill yours.
Then I'll kill you.
Please don't let them take me.
I'll get us home, I promise-no, no!
Peter.
I remember everything.
Takezo Kensei
I don't trust him, Maya.
See, when I get my ability back,
I'm gonna kill you and your sister.
we should put our faith on him
Caitlin!
Caitlin!
No need to shout.
Adam, I was there. I saw her.
You haven't gone anywhere, Peter.
You were telling me about time travel
And how you were going to save some girl
From some deadly virus,
And then you began shouting her name.
No, no, I was in New York city a year from now. I saw Caitlin.
I was calling at her to come back with me.
Look.
Evacuation Notice June 14th 2008
I have to keep trying.
I can't just leave her there to killed by the virus.
What do you know about this virus?
I know that it kills over 93% of the world's population.
Peter, do you know what the virus is called?
Shanti virus.
That's what the guy at homeland security called it.
Does that mean something to you?
I knew a woman at the company.
Victoria Pratt.
She was a biological engineer.
On valentine's day 1977, she recovered a deadly virus...
...from a sick indian girl named Shanti.
Under company orders,
She tried to manipulate the virus into a weapon.
I'd heard the program had been shut down.
Clearly I was misinformed.
Those are my parents.
Linderman, Charles Deveaux. What...
Those are the company founders, Peter.
The virus is their crime.
They're responsible for this.
Parents sin, children suffer.
That is Victoria.
We need to find her, Adam.
We need to find her.
Make her tell us everything that she knows.
That's the only way to stop the virus and save Caitlin.
It's the only way we can save the world.
Get the hell out of my house.
Noah Bennet was a loyal employee of our company,
And for many years a true friend.
I offer my deepest condolences.
Are those my dad's ashes?
You had my husband cremated?
Yes, his personnel file was very clear
What gives you the shit right?
We were only trying to help Claire
Use her abilities for the greater good.
But Noah's aggression forced our hand.
He was trying to protect me.
In the wake of this tragedy,
I feel it's only fair to honor Noah's wishes.
You will be left alone to lead a normal life.
My father is dead.
There is no normal.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Pack your bags. We're leaving tonight.
The next 24 hours are critical.
I want you to keep an eye on Claire.
It'd be easier without this thing on my arm.
It itches like a mother!
And I thought my little girl was tough.
I am, dad, but I was shot.
And my body doesn't heal itself.
I'm sorry you're in pain,
But none of this would've happened
If you hadn't lowered your guard.
How was I supposed to know that Bennet teamed up
With West, the flying boy?
Excuses don't change outcome, Elle.
You need to accept responsibility
For what's happened.
Can you do that?
Can you regain my trust?
Sure, daddy.
I'll watch the cheerleader.
Mohinder.
Take it easy.
Last thing I remember...
You were...
Did you shoot me?
I didn't have a choice.
Why am I not dead?
You would have been,
If you not for an infusion of your daughter's blood.
You took Claire's blood?
It saved your life.
You betrayed me. You went after my family!
You told me this company had to be brought down
From the inside out.
Thank god I came to my senses
Before I'd done any real damage.
What have you done with Claire?
Claire's at home,
Grieving the loss of her father.
They think I'm dead.
You put us on this path.
With your violence, your paranoia.
You have nobody to blame but yourself.
What are you doing with that?
Your recovery has proven
This blood has tremendous regenerative properties.
I believe it holds the key
To saving an innocent woman from a deadly virus.
That's what this company does.
We save lives.
Everything they've told you is a lie.
The company made that virus.
They've been experimenting with it for 30 years.
You can't trust them, Suresh!
Get back here, you son of a bitch!
600 bucks for a comic book?
In mint condition.
But that's not why I collect them.
I just like the stories.
How about this for a story?
Once upon a time, we cash these in
And live happily ever after, the end.
Hey, if St. Joan's a good guy,
Why is she wearing a hood?
Well, every superhero has to have a secret identity.
How else could they live a normal life?
Who wants normal?
Pssh, I'd be rolling large.
Let everybody know who I was.
But if your enemies knew who you really were,
Then they'd be coming after you at home,
Maybe even taking revenge on your family.
That's why Clark Kent wears those glasses.
Right.
Micah?
Mom, you came back!
I told you that I would.
I missed you every day.
Oh, I missed you every minute, every second.
What's that even smaller one?
A nanosecond.
I missed you that one too.
So where were you, mom?
I went to a place that helps people like us
When we're sick.
Is it Jessica again?
No, Jessica's gone. They all are.
This is about something else.
What is it?
I have a virus.
You don't have to worry.
I can't make you or anybody else sick.
What's gonna happen to you?
Do you remember dr. Suresh?
He is working really hard
To find me a cure.
And when he do, I'll get better.
Yeah, but what if he doesn't?
He will.
I am going to get better, Micah.
We are going to have normal life.
I promise you.
I've got something to make you stronger.
Oh, yeah? what's that?
Dad's medal.
The one that the mayogave him
For saving that girl from the fire.
It's in my backpack.
We can't waste another nanosecond.
What's wrong, bud?
It's my backpack. Ýt's gone.
It's beautiful here, Gabriel.
Thank you.
I almost feel normal.
After you see dr. Suresh, you will be.
And then Alejandro and I can go back home.
What if Alejandro could go home now?
But I need my brother.
He's the only one who can stop me
From hurting anyone else.
What if you could learn...
To control your own power?
I've seen people's powers grow.
Do you love your brother enough to let him go?
Of course.
It's...
It's just not possible.
Well, you'll never know...
Unless you try.
We should get back.
You put him through enough, Maya.
Me?
He gave up his entire life for you
Even after you killed his wife.
It was an accident.
You really think he's forgiven you?
She was cheating on him.
So she deserved to die?
That's not what I meant. Ýt's just...
Buyou wanted to kill her, didn't you, Maya?
Stop it. Let me go.
Where? Back to your brother?
He hates you.
Don't do this.
Please!o this.
If you can control your power,
No more innocent people have to die.
Ahh! Ý can't!
Help. You're killing me.
Help... please.
You were right.
I did it.
My father looked good in a suit.
I must find Takezo Kensei...
and avenge my father.
Are any of these Kensei? No.
But you're sure he did it?
I saw him on the roof of the Deveaux building.
Just before he pushed my father off.
You said Kensei died in White Beard's camp.
Even if he didn't...
how could anyone still be alive after 400 years?
Kensei could heal from any wound.
Maybe he could survive time as well.
You mean he could live forever?
If he did...
he would leave a trail.
I don't think we should go in there guns blazing.
Let's just tell Victoria the truth.
Ask her straight out where to find the virus.
This woman can't be trusted, Peter.
She worked for the company. She locked me up.
One glance at me on her garden path
Is liable to affect her mood.
Fine. I'll go alone.
No.
You lost?
Hope not.
I'm looking for victoria Pratt.
Never heard of her.
You worked for the company.
In 24 hours, the Shanti virus is released.
A year from now,
93% of the world's population is dead.
How can anyone know what happens a year from now?
I've been there.
I've seen it.
A time traveler.
You created a virus that kills billons of people.
I don't know how it gets out or where,
Only that it does.
Unless you help me.
Inside... now.
Ando, be more careful.
You are like...
a hamster making a nest.
Takezo Kensei and my father.
Kensei was calling himself ADAM MONROE.
Adam Monroe.
I saw that name.
From November 2, 1977.
It's a singed order to lock up Adam Monroe. Signed by my father.
This is it, Ando!
I must go back to this day.
But, Hiro.
You said you would never again travel in time.
That you wouldn't risk changing history.
The memo came from PRIMATECH RESEARCH in Hartsdale, New York.
I must do this.
Not again.
Containment breach in bio-research.
Evacuation protocol in full effect.
You have betrayed everything we stand for.
No, Kaito, I tried to save the world.
By releasing a virus
That could kill billons of innocent people?
When you're been around as long as I have,
The patterns become clear.
Constant war. Disregard for the environment.
Famine. And it's only getting worse.
Someone had to make the hard choice
For the greater good.
Take him down to lockup.
And throw away the key!
Are you all right, Victoria?
He was looking for Strain 138.
If he'd been successful,
This place would've been ground zero
For a global pandemic.
Thank you for saving us.
You need to shut down the program, Kaito.
Give it to me.
This will be taken
To the primatech facility in odessa.
With Adam locked away, it will be safe.
Look, with something that dangerous,
There is no safe.
That virus needs to be destroyed.
The other founders would never allow that.
Doesn't that concern you?
Adam had help, Kaito.
It's the only way he would have known what to look for.
I suggest you take a few days off
Before resuming your work.
I won't be a part of this. Not anymore.
After Kaito and the others were killed,
I figured that sooner or later
Someone would come after me.
You look like your mother.
I don't know anything about this.
The last time I saw my mother was a year from now,
In a future where the world had already been devastated
By the shanti virus.
Forgive my paranoia, but I don't know you.
I only knew your parents and what they were capable of.
There was a woman.
Caitlin.
She trusted me to protect her.
Now...
Somehow I took us into the future,
And now I can't get back.
So if you just tell me where to find the virus,
I know that I can save her.
You're looking for a mutated strain.
138.
If it were ever released,
It would kill us all.
She tell you where to find the virus?
Company storage facility in new mexico.
New mexico?
Company never had a facility...
Wait, you don't understand.
No, you're working with him now.
That's all I need to know.
I knew blowing your head off was the only way to be sure.
Better late than never.
Thanks, Peter.
Let's get her up to the house.
Alejandro!
I can control my power!
On my own!
It's all thanks to Gabriel
What did Gabriel do?
He showed me what I am capable of.
Isn't...
this wonderful news?
Maya
I looked up Gabriel Gray on the computer in the office.
He is a murderer.
The police say he killed his own mother.
I don't believe it.
It's not true.
We need to leave before...
Maya?
Did you tell your brother the good news?
I know what you are!
Is something wrong?
This...
Says you murdered your mother.
But I know you didn't. You couldn't.
It's te.
I did it.
I killed her.
He admits it?
When my mother found out what I could do,
She didn't understand.
Shtold me I was a monster.
My own mother tried to kill me, Maya.
And as I defended myself,
There was an accident.
I understand.
What are you doing Maya? Get away from him.
He's a murderer!
I am a murderer!
Gabriel understands exactly what I'm going throught
exactly how I feel.
We're leaving... now!
Alejandro no!
I'm staying with gabriel
We will go see Doctor Suresh without you.
I can control my own ability now.
I am not leaving you alone with him
I know you hate me.
I killed the woman you loved.
That wasn't your fault.
Yes it was.
In my heart, I wanted her dead.
Everything's gonna be okay, Maya.
I'll take care of you.
Why did you lie to me, Victoria?
You're with him.
You're helping Adam release the virus.
Release the virus?
I'm trying to find the virus so I can destroy it.
30 years ago, Adam broke into my lab.
I stopped him from releasing the virus
So he couldn't kill everyone.
And now he's trying to do it again.
I broke into the lab to prevent you and company
Fr putting the world in danger.
You killed Kaito, didn't you?
And the others. And now it's my turn.
We're trying save lives, Victoria, not take them.
Adam's a killer.
And I guess since you're helping him, you're one too.
Just like your parents.
Adam helped me escape the company.
He saved my brother's life.
But what you did, what you were a part of,
That will bring an end to the world.
Tell me where I can find the virus so I can stop it.
Go to hell.
Where is it, Victoria?
Primatech paper, odessa, texas.
Texas. No!
Thank you.
I am not gonna let you do this!
Get away from me!
We're not hurting you. We're letting you go.
What are you doing?
Wait!
You didn't have to kill her.
She was about to take your head off.
There's no coming back from that one.
I'm gonna get the car.
If anyone survives,
I'll tell them...
I couldn't have done it
Without you.
Well?
There was this kid on third street
Who said he can tell me how much
Your comics were worth.
I figured if you knew how much we'd get then maybe...
Where are they? where's my backpack?
It was a setup. I got jacked...
Micah! Damon!
My dad's medal was in that bag!
I'm sorry! Ý'll get you a new one!
You gonna get me a new dad, too?
I'm sorry.
I don't care! Ý hate you!
We're gonna get you all cleaned up.
And then I'm gonna call the police,
And you're gonna tell them everything that happened.
Come on.
We need to get it back.
Nana's calling the police.
I'm not talking about the police.
I'm talking about us. We could get it back.
We have talked about this.
We need to be heroes. Like dad.
Being a hero is what got your father killed.
Medals gone, I am sorry.
You all packed, Maya?
You're not taking my sister with you.
I tried to let you go the easy way.
But you had to be persistent.
I'm taking my sister.
Gabriel.
Gabriel!
I didn't hear you with the water running.
Is everything okay?
I have to talk to you.
Yeah?
You were right.
About everything.
About me. About Alejandro.
I never meant to come between you two.
He's my brother.
I have to do what I can to protect him.
In time, he will understand.
Of course he will.
And without you,
I would still be somewhere in mexico.
I just want to help you.
You have done that.
And some much more.
Your mom said you're leaving tonight.
I've fallen 20 stories.
Been stabbed in the head.
Crashed a car at 70 miles an hour.
I've even been on fire.
But this hurts...
More than any of that.
And it's not getting better.
I've always gotten better no matter what,
But this just keeps getting worse.
I can't stand to see you hurt like this.
I won't be. Not for long.
There's a man who used to work with my dad.
He has the ability to erase people's memories.
These are a signal
So that he knows to come.
Are you gonna hang those in the window?
How do you know he's gonna see them?
I don't know, but I have to do something.
You don't want to forget your dad.
Forgetting isn't the answer.
I just wish I could tell him how sorry I am.
Micah.
Why are you dressed like that?
I know what it's like to lose someone you love.
To wish that you had a piece of them,
Something solid to hold onto.
Anybody tried to steal my mom's piano,
I'd feed'em their teeth.
Look.
I know where those kids live.
The ones who stole your backpack.
You're gonna help me get back my dad's medal?
Long as you stay out of the way.
Anything crazy happens, I need you safe.
Okay, I promise.
Shh, we still gotta sneak you out.
Come on.
It's as we'd hoped.
Claire's blood has fortified my antibodies.
They're strong enough to defeat
The mutated virus now.
Congratulations, doctor.
You promised Niki Sanders you'd find a ce,
And you have.
And you promised me
This company's viral research would end.
In working up this cure, I've been pouring over records
That reveal the full extent of your program.
And you of all people should understand
What it would mean to find a safe way
To remove the abilities of dangerous individuals.
Here, Strain 138.
If even the smallest amount were released,
It would wipe out all of human civilization.
This strain is locked safely away
In our facility in texas.
And I can assure you, doctor,
This company is vigilant about security.
Really?
For weeks I operated as a spy
Within your ranks undetected.
God knows what someone with experience
And ill intent could achieve.
What can I do for you?
Help me hunt down every strain of virus
Within this company and destroy them.
Hello.
Niki? Ýt's Mohinder Suresh.
Are you still in new orleans?
Yes.
I think I found the cure, Niki.
I'll bring to you on the next flight.
You're nightmare's over.
I don't know what to say, doctor.
Thank you.
Micah.
There's no one home.
You should have plenty of time.
You know how to get up there yet?
Almost.
Got it.
I just wish it wasn't so bright.
I don't want people thinking I'm robbing the place.
Okay.
How did you do that?
I told the lights I need them to be off for a while.
You told'em.
Yeah.
What?
You're st. Joan!
You really have to stop reading those comic books.
Stay here.
I'm sorry, dad.
Who cares?
As long as he come with that cash
I'm sorry I didn't listen.
I should've done everything you told me to.
If I hadn't been so selfish, you'd still be here.
You'd better say good-bye.
We gotta be in salt lake by morning.
Come on.
This is all happening so fast.
I'm losing everything I care about.
Claire!
What the hell are you doing here?
I came to watch the sunset.
Liar! Ugh!
Watch who you're shoving, pompom.
Claire, don't.
This isn't fair.
Welcome to life.
Come on, Claire, we've gotta go.
No, mom, we don't.
We can tell the world what they did.
How they kidnapped me and murdered my father.
You have no proof. No one would believe you.
You're probably right.
I guess I'm just gonna have to show'em.
I'll show everyone exactly what I can do.
Once the secret's out,
You wot be able to touch me or my family.
You'll be the ones running.
Hello.
Hello, Mohinder.
Sylar?
Where are you?
I convinced the babysitter to take the night off.
Don't worry.
I'm taking good care of the little one.
If you touch Molly...
We won't want to wake her.
I brought someone to see you.
She needs your help.
We both do
See you soon, Mohinder.
Ando, wake up.
Hiro!You're back!
I know what Adam wants!
What is it?
A virus.
At a place called Primatech.
It's in Texas, Ando!Back in Odessa!
Where we tried to save the cheerleader?
Yes!
Adam wants to release this virus!
If I don't stop him, they'll die!
Who?
Everyone!
But Adam is invincible.
How can you stop a man like that?
I must try.
I must avenge my father's death...
and save the world.
Why is saving the world always your reponsibility?
This doesn't look like the sort of place
Where they'd store a virus that could destroy the world.
Paper company's just a front.
The good stuff is three floors down.
Laboratories, jail cells...
Hiro?
Peter petrelli?
What are you doing here?
Adam Monroe killed my father, and for that he must pay.
I can't let you do that.
Then you have chosen the wrong side.
No!
I can't let you hurt him.
