      "112: 0:00:01.770000 -- It was a pedicure.\n",
      "113: 0:00:01.410000 -- I'm sorry.\n",
      "114: 0:00:00.710000 -- The other night.\n",
      "115: 0:00:01.080000 -- That's what I was doing.\n",
      "116: 0:00:01.910000 -- I was giving myself a pedicure.\n",
      "117: 0:00:02.110000 -- You're not very good at it.\n",
      "118: 0:00:02.500000 -- What is it with you creeping around my house at night anyway?\n",
      "119: 0:00:01.350000 -- Just tryin' to lend you a book.\n",
      "120: 0:00:03.050000 -- Okay, you know what, if I want to start a book club with you, I'll let you know.\n",
      "121: 0:00:01.520000 -- Until then, just stay away from me.\n",
      "122: 0:00:00.530000 -- Will do.\n",
      "123: 0:00:01.380000 -- Just walk me through this one last time.\n",
      "124: 0:00:01.780000 -- I didn't see you cut off your toe, is that right?\n",
      "125: 0:00:03.210000 -- The bottle of nail polish fell over and it just looked like it was bleeding.\n",
      "126: 0:00:01.690000 -- Improvising is really not your forte.\n",
      "127: 0:00:01.420000 -- Why are you such a smart-ass?\n",
      "128: 0:00:01.590000 -- Why are you so bad at lying?\n",
      "129: 0:00:01.290000 -- I'm not lying.\n",
      "130: 0:00:01.830000 -- Fine then. You gave yourself a pedicure.\n",
      "131: 0:00:01.820000 -- And your toe came off and then came back on.\n",
      "132: 0:00:01 -- Works for me.\n",
      "133: 0:00:01.900000 -- I'm going to class.\n",
      "134: 0:00:02.290000 -- Don't do your nails on the way.\n",
      "135: 0:00:00.980000 -- Freeze!\n",
      "136: 0:00:01.410000 -- Oh, for god's sake.\n",
      "137: 0:00:00.840000 -- Mohinder.\n",
      "138: 0:00:00.680000 -- Quiet down.\n",
      "139: 0:00:00.740000 -- You'll wake Molly.\n",
      "140: 0:00:01.760000 -- What are you doing home? I thought you were in Cairo.\n",
      "141: 0:00:00.980000 -- Haiti, actually.\n",
      "142: 0:00:01.450000 -- My plane got in a couple of hours ago.\n",
      "143: 0:00:01.780000 -- I'll be working here in the city from now on.\n",
      "144: 0:00:01.270000 -- I thought you were in the field.\n",
      "145: 0:00:01.860000 -- They're setting me up in a place downtown.\n",
      "146: 0:00:02.140000 -- Which means I'll be around to help with Molly.\n",
      "147: 0:00:03.180000 -- Which means you're going to be doing your spy work in our own back yard-Great.\n",
      "148: 0:00:02.100000 -- Someone's grouchy when they don't get their sleep.\n",
      "149: 0:00:01.240000 -- Molly's struggling.\n",
      "150: 0:00:01.290000 -- Nightmares, problems at school.\n",
      "151: 0:00:02.270000 -- I can't babysit her and you at the same time.\n",
      "152: 0:00:01.610000 -- And why would I need babysitting?\n",
      "153: 0:00:01.310000 -- You're in over your head.\n",
      "154: 0:00:02.670000 -- - Thank you, but- - they abducted me.\n",
      "155: 0:00:00.760000 -- Kept me prisoner.\n",
      "156: 0:00:01.350000 -- I know you think you can beat them at their own game,\n",
      "157: 0:00:02.700000 -- but, Mohinder, no offense, you're a professor.\n",
      "158: 0:00:00.910000 -- You're not 007.\n",
      "159: 0:00:02.590000 -- I told myself I would do whatever it took to take down the company.\n",
      "160: 0:00:01.290000 -- That's how I can help Molly.\n",
      "161: 0:00:01.780000 -- You want to help Molly?\n",
      "162: 0:00:01.130000 -- Don't die on her.\n",
      "163: 0:00:02.300000 -- Mohinder, you're home!\n",
      "164: 0:00:01.430000 -- That's right.\n",
      "165: 0:00:02.530000 -- And I'm never leaving again.\n",
      "166: 0:00:01.560000 -- What in heaven?\n",
      "167: 0:00:01.900000 -- All this blood and no wound.\n",
      "168: 0:00:01.820000 -- You have a power!\n",
      "169: 0:00:01.400000 -- An amazing power!\n",
      "170: 0:00:01.400000 -- What have you done to me?\n",
      "171: 0:00:02.720000 -- This is how you become a hero!\n",
      "172: 0:00:01.500000 -- This is impossible.\n",
      "173: 0:00:01.370000 -- This must be some sort of trick.\n",
      "174: 0:00:01.570000 -- No. Look.\n",
      "175: 0:00:01.940000 -- Lazarus risen.\n",
      "176: 0:00:01.320000 -- You've cursed me.\n",
      "177: 0:00:01.180000 -- No. This is not a curse.\n",
      "178: 0:00:01.370000 -- It's a gift.\n",
      "179: 0:00:02.360000 -- This gift will help you through the trials.\n",
      "180: 0:00:05.140000 -- To help find the fire scroll, uh, the 90 hungry ronins, help rescue Yaeko's father.\n",
      "181: 0:00:01.480000 -- Get away from me!\n",
      "182: 0:00:01.300000 -- You're a devil.\n",
      "183: 0:00:02.580000 -- No, no. I'm here to help you.\n",
      "184: 0:00:01.910000 -- Kensei, wait!\n",
      "185: 0:00:02.930000 -- We have to write history!\n",
      "186: 0:00:01.330000 -- Lightning.\n",
      "187: 0:00:00.660000 -- Lightning!\n",
      "188: 0:00:00.960000 -- Sparks!\n",
      "189: 0:00:01.180000 -- Lightning!\n",
      "190: 0:00:01.970000 -- So you just yell it out.\n",
      "191: 0:00:02.140000 -- Well, I'm just trying to understand how it works.\n",
      "192: 0:00:01.670000 -- That makes two of us.\n",
      "193: 0:00:02.200000 -- So far, I got nothin'.\n",
      "194: 0:00:03.290000 -- Well, it's a shame you can't order lightning up like a plate of chips.\n",
      "195: 0:00:02.370000 -- Sure would come in handy tonight.\n",
      "196: 0:00:02.200000 -- God, you know, I can do all these things.\n",
      "197: 0:00:03.440000 -- It's just-I feel powerless.\n",
      "198: 0:00:02.020000 -- It's tough not knowing who you are.\n",
      "199: 0:00:03.340000 -- Yeah, looks like I might just die before I ever figure it out.\n",
      "200: 0:00:04.070000 -- Maybe you're an extraterrestrial, escaped from a government facility.\n",
      "201: 0:00:04.260000 -- I have to admit, I'm pretty excited to see you open that box.\n",
      "202: 0:00:01.980000 -- And don't worry about tonight.\n",
      "203: 0:00:01.700000 -- I'll be there to watch your back.\n",
      "204: 0:00:01.890000 -- How do I know I can trust you?\n",
      "205: 0:00:03.280000 -- I haven't told anyone about what you can do, now have I?\n",
      "206: 0:00:01.640000 -- Why is that?\n",
      "207: 0:00:02.380000 -- Girl's gotta have her secrets.\n",
      "208: 0:00:02.680000 -- Dude, you look like ass.\n",
      "209: 0:00:01.900000 -- No English.\n",
      "210: 0:00:01.230000 -- All right.\n",
      "211: 0:00:03.070000 -- Today, we are talking about Mitosis.\n",
      "212: 0:00:01.010000 -- Yes, West.\n",
      "213: 0:00:01.800000 -- I have a question about yesterday's topic.\n",
      "214: 0:00:01.170000 -- \"Regeneration in lizards. \"\n",
      "215: 0:00:02.270000 -- Now, I know you said humans couldn't regenerate.\n",
      "216: 0:00:02.520000 -- But what if a lizard were to mate with a human?\n",
      "217: 0:00:01.170000 -- Could their offspring do it?\n",
      "218: 0:00:01.990000 -- Because I think I met a lizard girl.\n",
      "219: 0:00:03.040000 -- This doesn't strike me as a productive conversation, West.\n",
      "220: 0:00:00.620000 -- But seriously.\n",
      "221: 0:00:04.650000 -- What if that lizard girl were to accidentally cut off her arm,\n",
      "222: 0:00:02.840000 -- or a leg, or you name the appendage, in some kind of...\n",
      "223: 0:00:02.050000 -- horrifying spa-debacle?\n",
      "224: 0:00:01.940000 -- Where exactly are you going with this?\n",
      "225: 0:00:05.570000 -- Would said appendage reattach itself back onto her lizard body?\n",
      "226: 0:00:04.290000 -- I cut myself and the wound heals\n",
      "227: 0:00:02.050000 -- over and over again.\n",
      "228: 0:00:02.160000 -- You are a hero, like me.\n",
      "229: 0:00:01.200000 -- I have powers too.\n",
      "230: 0:00:01.570000 -- You?\n",
      "231: 0:00:01.780000 -- - Really? - Yes.\n",
      "232: 0:00:03.140000 -- I can stop time and move through space.\n",
      "233: 0:00:01.370000 -- Hello.\n",
      "234: 0:00:02.380000 -- How are such things possible?\n",
      "235: 0:00:02.670000 -- Some say it's a gift from God.\n",
      "236: 0:00:03.220000 -- Some people think it's evolution.\n",
      "237: 0:00:02.200000 -- What is that? Evolution?\n",
      "238: 0:00:03.470000 -- It means you can heal from any wound.\n",
      "239: 0:00:00.970000 -- Really?\n",
      "240: 0:00:01.550000 -- Any wound?\n",
      "241: 0:00:01.720000 -- Sword?\n",
      "242: 0:00:01.680000 -- Serpent?\n",
      "243: 0:00:01.370000 -- Fire?\n",
      "244: 0:00:02.650000 -- This'll make me richer than the Pope.\n",
      "245: 0:00:01.700000 -- - Rich? - Yes!\n",
      "246: 0:00:02.360000 -- Swordsman are obsessed with duels in this country.\n",
      "247: 0:00:01.130000 -- I'll clean up in wages.\n",
      "248: 0:00:04.310000 -- You have to defeat white beard and fight the 90 angry Ronin.\n",
      "249: 0:00:03.430000 -- If you're obsessed with my stories so much, how about you handle them?\n",
      "250: 0:00:02.560000 -- Kensei, you have to stopwalking away from your destiny!\n",
      "251: 0:00:01.900000 -- Who's going to stop me?\n",
      "252: 0:00:01.430000 -- Who?\n",
      "253: 0:00:03.900000 -- No one is going to stop me because no one can stop me.\n",
      "254: 0:00:02.060000 -- God. This is extraordinary!\n",
      "255: 0:00:01.490000 -- Where have you taken me?\n",
      "256: 0:00:01.710000 -- To get the fire scroll.\n",
      "257: 0:00:02.260000 -- It's on top of those steps.\n",
      "258: 0:00:01.700000 -- Who are they?\n",
      "259: 0:00:03.500000 -- Those are the 90 angry ronin, sworn to protect it.\n",
      "260: 0:00:01.560000 -- How angry are they?\n",
      "261: 0:00:01.340000 -- Good luck, Kensei.\n",
      "262: 0:00:01.660000 -- You can do this.\n",
      "263: 0:00:01.980000 -- I take it you're annoyed.\n",
      "264: 0:00:01.840000 -- What is it, West?\n",
      "265: 0:00:01.580000 -- What do you want from me?\n",
      "266: 0:00:02.790000 -- I want you to admit you're different.\n",
      "267: 0:00:01.230000 -- Okay, fine.\n",
      "268: 0:00:01.460000 -- I'm a freak. All right?\n",
      "269: 0:00:00.980000 -- Claire.\n",
      "270: 0:00:01.580000 -- I am such a freak, in fact,\n",
      "271: 0:00:03.430000 -- that I have to tiptoe around this school pretending to be some brainless barbie doll\n",
      "272: 0:00:02.520000 -- so nobody notices how different I am.\n",
      "273: 0:00:03.870000 -- 'Cause if they found out, I'd be carted off to some human zoo\n",
      "274: 0:00:02.980000 -- so I could be poked and prodded at for the rest of my life.\n",
      "275: 0:00:03.170000 -- So yeah, West, I'm different.\n",
      "276: 0:00:01.610000 -- And you can tell the world if you want to,\n",
      "277: 0:00:02.880000 -- because I am tired of pretending to be someone I'm not.\n",
      "278: 0:00:04.160000 -- Claire, shut up.\n",
      "279: 0:00:01.730000 -- Be careful.\n",
      "280: 0:00:01.560000 -- You too.\n",
      "281: 0:00:00.940000 -- Yes, who's there?\n",
      "282: 0:00:01.320000 -- Safeline. Here for the pickup.\n",
      "283: 0:00:01.200000 -- I want my money back.\n",
      "284: 0:00:01.650000 -- All right, back away, friend.\n",
      "285: 0:00:00.940000 -- I'm not your friend, okay?\n",
      "286: 0:00:01.390000 -- Just give me my $200 back.\n",
      "287: 0:00:02.560000 -- Look, Celtic was supposed to be a lock to win, okay?\n",
      "288: 0:00:01.100000 -- Just help a guy out.\n",
      "289: 0:00:01.450000 -- That's not our problem.\n",
      "290: 0:00:01.850000 -- Actually, it is your problem.\n",
      "291: 0:00:01.260000 -- Tie him up, Tuko.\n",
      "292: 0:00:08.180000 -- Mind these two.\n",
      "293: 0:00:01.440000 -- Stay down!\n",
      "294: 0:00:01.840000 -- That'll be that now.\n",
      "295: 0:00:01.470000 -- There he is!\n",
      "296: 0:00:01.570000 -- Stop!\n",
      "297: 0:00:01.530000 -- Go!\n",
      "298: 0:00:01.710000 -- Isn't this Isaac Mendez's loft?\n",
      "299: 0:00:01.100000 -- The painter.\n",
      "300: 0:00:01.430000 -- It was.\n",
      "301: 0:00:01.900000 -- Until Sylar killed him.\n",
      "302: 0:00:01.390000 -- He was murdered?\n",
      "303: 0:00:03.370000 -- Every space has some unhappiness in its past.\n",
      "304: 0:00:03.940000 -- The company recently poured a lot of money into outfitting this laboratory.\n",
      "305: 0:00:02.110000 -- Everything state of the art.\n",
      "306: 0:00:02.340000 -- Well, lucky timing for me then.\n",
      "307: 0:00:02.940000 -- Mohinder, it was built for you.\n",
      "308: 0:00:01.400000 -- I'm sorry.\n",
      "309: 0:00:03.410000 -- You don't realize how valued you are here at the company.\n",
      "310: 0:00:04.150000 -- Our people have been instructed to keep a close watch on you.\n",
      "311: 0:00:01.950000 -- To anticipate your every need.\n",
      "312: 0:00:01.780000 -- That is very generous of you.\n",
      "313: 0:00:02.140000 -- But really, I prefer to work on my own.\n",
      "314: 0:00:02.770000 -- Supervision is in your best interest...\n",
      "315: 0:00:02.050000 -- and in ours.\n",
      "316: 0:00:02.390000 -- You're part of the family now.\n",
      "317: 0:00:02.490000 -- You're sure Kensei is coming?\n",
      "318: 0:00:02.150000 -- Oh, yes!\n",
      "319: 0:00:01.610000 -- Maybe he's been killed.\n",
      "320: 0:00:01.710000 -- Or kidnapped.\n",
      "321: 0:00:06.680000 -- Not Kensei. He knows you are waiting for him.\n",
      "322: 0:00:02.540000 -- You have so much faith in him.\n",

      "325: 0:00:01.710000 -- One is a brute.\n",
      "326: 0:00:02.630000 -- But the other Kensei...\n",
      "327: 0:00:04.100000 -- he is gentle.\n",
      "328: 0:00:01.560000 -- Really?\n",
      "329: 0:00:01.520000 -- Things'll be better now.\n",
      "330: 0:00:01.430000 -- You'll see.\n",
      "331: 0:00:02.140000 -- But you have to remember your promise.\n",
      "332: 0:00:01.450000 -- No more powers.\n",
      "333: 0:00:03.830000 -- I just don't see the point of us having these abilities when we don't even use them.\n",
      "334: 0:00:02.510000 -- The point is staying safe.\n",
      "335: 0:00:02.900000 -- This is your chance at a normal life...\n",
      "336: 0:00:01.920000 -- with normal people.\n",
      "337: 0:00:02.360000 -- They wouldn't understand.\n",
      "338: 0:00:02.080000 -- I just don't want you to go.\n",
      "339: 0:00:02.140000 -- I'll only be gone for awhile.\n",
      "340: 0:00:01.850000 -- And you're gonna be staying with family.\n",
      "341: 0:00:01.390000 -- It could be fun.\n",
      "342: 0:00:01.680000 -- I don't even know them.\n",

      "344: 0:00:03.350000 -- But I do know that when I get back, we'll be together.\n",
      "345: 0:00:01.630000 -- I have to do this.\n",
      "346: 0:00:03.070000 -- That's what you always say before you do something bad.\n",
      "347: 0:00:01.930000 -- I love you.\n",

      "349: 0:00:01.980000 -- What is that?\n",
      "350: 0:00:01.410000 -- W- wait.\n",
      "351: 0:00:01.570000 -- Take me with you.\n",
      "352: 0:00:01.850000 -- I have a car.\n",
      "353: 0:00:01.560000 -- Oh, jeez.\n",
      "354: 0:00:01.370000 -- Look at that.\n",
      "355: 0:00:01.470000 -- Gorgeous.\n",
      "356: 0:00:01.600000 -- I'd say we earned these.\n",
      "357: 0:00:01.190000 -- Damn right.\n",
      "358: 0:00:01.500000 -- Hey, drink up.\n",
      "359: 0:00:01.420000 -- Slainte.\n",
      "360: 0:00:02.280000 -- All right, will the traitor.\n",
      "361: 0:00:01.280000 -- Please don't shoot.\n",
      "362: 0:00:01.440000 -- This is no joke.\n",

      "364: 0:00:01.680000 -- so I was right.\n",
      "365: 0:00:01.870000 -- That you were.\n",
      "366: 0:00:01.380000 -- Congratulations, Peter.\n",
      "367: 0:00:01.440000 -- Peter!\n",
      "368: 0:00:02.090000 -- Hold your horses, sweetheart!\n",
      "369: 0:00:02.920000 -- Now, about that money.\n",
      "370: 0:00:01.540000 -- No way.\n",
      "371: 0:00:02.110000 -- Give me the damn money!\n",
      "372: 0:00:01.810000 -- Peter.\n",
      "373: 0:00:01.840000 -- What the...\n",
      "374: 0:00:01.960000 -- What the jeez\n",
      "375: 0:00:01.810000 -- What's he doin'?\n",
      "376: 0:00:01.900000 -- Peter!\n",
      "377: 0:00:01.260000 -- Hiro.\n",
      "378: 0:00:02.040000 -- I was worried you wouldn't return.\n",
      "379: 0:00:00.890000 -- But you did.\n",
      "380: 0:00:01.380000 -- You brought back the scroll.\n",
      "381: 0:00:03.230000 -- Now I know that you will get the rest of them up to White Beard's camp.\n",
      "382: 0:00:02.220000 -- And even Yaeko loves you.\n",
      "383: 0:00:01.860000 -- I can leave now.\n",
      "384: 0:00:01.360000 -- Wait.\n",
      "385: 0:00:01.860000 -- Wait. You're going?\n",
      "386: 0:00:02.180000 -- Yes, I have another life to go to.\n",
      "387: 0:00:01.890000 -- My father... Ando...\n",
      "388: 0:00:01.920000 -- they're all waiting for me.\n",
      "389: 0:00:02.490000 -- But what if I can't do this without you?\n",
      "390: 0:00:03.210000 -- Only you can keep me from returning to my heathen ways.\n",
      "391: 0:00:01.857000 -- You're like a conscience.\n",
      "392: 0:00:01.788000 -- Only I take heed of you.\n",
      "393: 0:00:02.710000 -- I almost broke history by coming back here.\n",
      "394: 0:00:02.665000 -- If I stay, I risk making it worse.\n",
      "395: 0:00:02.070000 -- I don't know what to say, carp.\n",
      "396: 0:00:02.670000 -- You've done this grubby soul a great kindness.\n",
      "397: 0:00:01.825000 -- I thank you.\n",
      "398: 0:00:01.830000 -- - It has been my honor. - No.\n",
      "399: 0:00:01.175000 -- No,\n",
      "400: 0:00:01.825000 -- it is I who am honored...\n",
      "401: 0:00:02.610000 -- to meet the great Takezo Kensei.\n",
      "402: 0:00:01.710000 -- Bye, friend.\n",
      "403: 0:00:01.090000 -- Kensei!\n",
      "404: 0:00:01.210000 -- Kensei!\n",
      "405: 0:00:02.300000 -- I made you some breakfast.\n",
      "406: 0:00:02.340000 -- I can't make it move.\n",
      "407: 0:00:04.530000 -- That cup. I used to be able to make things move with my mind.\n",
      "408: 0:00:02.575000 -- Thanks for making breakfast, Michelle, you're a real sport.\n",
      "409: 0:00:02.940000 -- I can't freeze anything. I can't move things. What happened to them?\n",
      "410: 0:00:02.617000 -- Uh, they must've disappeared with your injuries.\n",
      "411: 0:00:02.583000 -- I thought you said you were taking care of me?\n",
      "412: 0:00:02.490000 -- I'm sorry. Uh, are you breathing?\n",
      "413: 0:00:02.335000 -- No collapsed lung? No infection from the wound?\n",
      "414: 0:00:03.620000 -- Everything that I've been working for, everything that I had, it's gone.\n",
      "415: 0:00:03.585000 -- Listen, the people I work for, they're gonna make sure you get better.\n",
      "416: 0:00:03.180000 -- Your back's already healed. It's just your chest we're worried about.\n",
      "417: 0:00:01.870000 -- And when that heals,\n",
      "418: 0:00:02.300000 -- you'll be able to re-acquire your powers.\n",
      "419: 0:00:02.675000 -- With my help, of course.\n",
      "420: 0:00:01.315000 -- You.\n",
      "421: 0:00:01.745000 -- How are you gonna help?\n",
      "422: 0:00:02.460000 -- You gonna make me some more eggs?\n",
      "423: 0:00:02 -- By making it easy.\n",
      "424: 0:00:01.505000 -- By making it fun.\n",
      "425: 0:00:02.220000 -- I can take you anywhere you want to go.\n",
      "426: 0:00:01.835000 -- Paris. London.\n",
      "427: 0:00:01.800000 -- How about Japan?\n",
      "428: 0:00:01.765000 -- And I can be...\n",
      "429: 0:00:02.290000 -- anyone you want me to be.\n",
      "430: 0:00:03.990000 -- If your fantasy is exotic...\n",
      "431: 0:00:02.570000 -- or more run-of-the-mill.\n",
      "432: 0:00:05.780000 -- Or something more familiar, if that's what you're into.\n",
      "433: 0:00:02.595000 -- Don't you see? I can help you.\n",
      "434: 0:00:03.070000 -- We were meant to do this together.\n",
      "435: 0:00:02.300000 -- I under-estimated you.\n",
      "436: 0:00:02.830000 -- You really are extraordinary.\n",
      "437: 0:00:02.010000 -- Just like me.\n",
      "438: 0:00:01.435000 -- You were right.\n",
      "439: 0:00:02.660000 -- I am gonna get my abilities back.\n",
      "440: 0:00:02.730000 -- Starting with yours.\n",
      "441: 0:00:02.690000 -- So this is what you really look like.\n",
      "442: 0:00:03.700000 -- So silly trying to be something that you're not.\n",
      "443: 0:00:03.110000 -- Well, Michelle or Candice or whoever you are,\n",
      "444: 0:00:02.280000 -- it wasn't all for nothing.\n",
      "445: 0:00:02.260000 -- Thanks to you...\n",
      "446: 0:00:02.500000 -- I'll be going back to Maui now.\n",
      "447: 0:00:01.770000 -- London.\n",
      "448: 0:00:02.060000 -- Japan.\n",
      "449: 0:00:01.760000 -- Japan!\n",
      "450: 0:00:02.145000 -- It's not working.\n",
      "451: 0:00:02.110000 -- I don't have it.\n",
      "452: 0:00:02.330000 -- Your power. What's wrong with me?\n",
      "453: 0:00:01.580000 -- Ahh!\n",
      "454: 0:00:02.710000 -- Ah, would you quit being such a baby,\n",
      "455: 0:00:01.565000 -- Pretty boy?\n",
      "456: 0:00:01.520000 -- Peter.\n",
      "457: 0:00:02.180000 -- I may not know what you are,\n",
      "458: 0:00:02.250000 -- but I know who you are.\n",
      "459: 0:00:02.230000 -- You're one of us.\n",
      "460: 0:00:03.110000 -- And we have no secrets among family.\n",
      "461: 0:00:01.260000 -- Well?\n",
      "462: 0:00:01.890000 -- Well what?\n",
      "463: 0:00:01.690000 -- This is it.\n",
      "464: 0:00:01.765000 -- Your box. Your life.\n",
      "465: 0:00:02.340000 -- You gonna open it or what?\n",
      "466: 0:00:02.440000 -- What if it's a life I don't want?\n",
      "467: 0:00:02.160000 -- When I had Will against the wall,\n",
      "468: 0:00:01.655000 -- I could've killed him.\n",
      "469: 0:00:02.005000 -- I wanted to.\n",
      "470: 0:00:01.635000 -- What if that's who I am?\n",
      "471: 0:00:02.770000 -- - But you didn't kill him, did you? - No, that's because of you.\n",
      "472: 0:00:02.495000 -- It's not because of me, Peter.\n",
      "473: 0:00:02.100000 -- You're a good soul.\n",
      "474: 0:00:02.030000 -- I can tell.\n",
      "475: 0:00:03.410000 -- What if I open this box and I find otherwise?\n",
      "476: 0:00:02.600000 -- Do you like the way you are right now?\n",
      "477: 0:00:02.460000 -- Do you like who you are right now?\n",
      "478: 0:00:02.270000 -- Well, then maybe for now\n",
      "479: 0:00:02.005000 -- just leave it be.\n",
      "480: 0:00:01.875000 -- I think yours is cooler.\n",
      "481: 0:00:01.895000 -- Any time your parents get annoying,\n",
      "482: 0:00:02.470000 -- you can just open the window and take off.\n",
      "483: 0:00:01.400000 -- Are you kidding?\n",
      "484: 0:00:01.795000 -- You're indestructible.\n",
      "485: 0:00:02.225000 -- You can skydive without a parachute.\n",
      "486: 0:00:02.190000 -- You could skydive without a plane.\n",
      "487: 0:00:02.030000 -- you can eat fire just for kicks.\n",
      "488: 0:00:01.805000 -- I feel pain.\n",
      "489: 0:00:02.155000 -- I just get over it quickly.\n",
      "490: 0:00:02.440000 -- So how would it feel then if I-if I do this?\n",
      "491: 0:00:01.740000 -- Ow... It hurts!\n",
      "492: 0:00:01.880000 -- What about this then?\n",
      "493: 0:00:01.990000 -- What's on your neck?\n",
      "494: 0:00:02.930000 -- A couple years ago, when we were living in St. Louis\n",
      "495: 0:00:02.025000 -- I was riding my bike to school,\n",
      "496: 0:00:04.070000 -- and next thing I knew it was a day later and I was waking up in my bed.\n",
      "497: 0:00:02.165000 -- Last thing I remember is\n",
      "498: 0:00:02.880000 -- this man stepping out of the bushes calling my name.\n",
      "499: 0:00:02.065000 -- What are you talking about? What man?\n",
      "500: 0:00:01.555000 -- I don't know who he was.\n",
      "501: 0:00:02.410000 -- But I remember the way he looked at me.\n",
      "502: 0:00:02.450000 -- Like I was an animal he wanted to trap.\n",
      "503: 0:00:03.260000 -- I try to put him out of my head. But sometimes I can see his face.\n",
      "504: 0:00:02.660000 -- That guy with the horn-rimmed glasses.\n",
      "505: 0:00:02.010000 -- I have another vial.\n",
      "506: 0:00:02.290000 -- I'll get started on it right away.\n",
      "507: 0:00:01.480000 -- Yeah?\n",
      "508: 0:00:02.620000 -- I have to take this outside.\n",
      "509: 0:00:02.320000 -- - Where are you? - I just got here.\n",
      "510: 0:00:02.445000 -- I'm sitting in your office.\n",
      "511: 0:00:02.630000 -- Are you sure you're gonna be able to cure me?\n",
      "512: 0:00:01.350000 -- Yes.\n",
      "513: 0:00:01.965000 -- And like I said, in exchange,\n",
      "514: 0:00:03.160000 -- we're going to want a little something from you.\n",
      "515: 0:00:03.090000 -- They're moving the paintings somewhere. There's only a few crates left.\n",
      "516: 0:00:03.480000 -- This was a terrible idea. This guy's watching my every move.\n",
      "517: 0:00:02.335000 -- I can't do this. I'm in over my head.\n",
      "518: 0:00:02.265000 -- I told you you have no reason to worry.\n",
      "519: 0:00:02.961000 -- As long as I'm alive, you will be taken care of.\n",
      "520: 0:00:02.950000 -- - That's exactly the problem. - What are you talking about?\n",
      "521: 0:00:02.475000 -- I'm sending you a Jpeg of a painting I found.\n",
      "522: 0:00:03.460000 -- The rest have been shipped off somewhere. It's the last in the series. 8 of 8.\n",
      "523: 0:00:03.920000 -- we know how it begins with the death of Kaito Nakamura. But how does it end?\n",

      "525: 0:00:02.150000 -- Night, Claire.\n",

      "523: 0:00:03.059000 -- I used to climb up to the top of it.\n",
      "524: 0:00:01.200000 -- See what i could do.\n",
      "525: 0:00:01.200000 -- You'd jump off?\n",
      "526: 0:00:00.600000 -- Yeah.\n",

      "529: 0:00:01.100000 -- Why did it go away?\n",
      "530: 0:00:01.300000 -- I can't tell you that.\n",
      "531: 0:00:01.500000 -- The truth is so many terrible things\n",

      "537: 0:00:01.100000 -- Then jump.\n",
      "538: 0:00:00.700000 -- What?\n",
      "539: 0:00:02.059000 -- Trust begins with a leap. Oh!\n",
      "540: 0:00:00.859000 -- Cheesy, but true.\n",
      "541: 0:00:01.659000 -- Oh, no, it'll be gross.\n",
      "542: 0:00:01.759000 -- My arms pop out of their sockets\n",
      "543: 0:00:02.159000 -- and sometimes my feet come out facing each other.\n",
      "544: 0:00:01.759000 -- It's... it's not cute.\n",
      "545: 0:00:03.159000 -- Claire, these fears you have\n",
      "546: 0:00:02.900000 -- of someone finding out about you,\n",
      "547: 0:00:01.700000 -- of feeling different forever,\n",
      "548: 0:00:01.300000 -- i have them too.\n",
      "549: 0:00:01.400000 -- You can share them with me,\n",
      "550: 0:00:03.359000 -- but i can't help you if you don't trust me.\n",
      "551: 0:00:00.900000 -- Okay.\n",

      "567: 0:00:01.200000 -- How did you get that?\n",
      "568: 0:00:02 -- Turns out micah's some type of genius\n",
      "569: 0:00:01.259000 -- and rigged the cable.\n",
      "570: 0:00:00.900000 -- Is that true?\n",

      "575: 0:00:01.959000 -- after everything you've been through.\n",
      "576: 0:00:02.300000 -- But i promised your mother that i'd look after you.\n",
      "577: 0:00:02.259000 -- So you gotta obey the rules around here, okay?\n",

      "601: 0:00:02.659000 -- I've tried, but that's the thing about criminals.\n",
      "602: 0:00:02.359000 -- They... they don't like to be found.\n",
      "603: 0:00:01.200000 -- He's a bad guy?\n",
      "604: 0:00:03.159000 -- My dad stole a lot of money from a lot of people.\n",

      "626: 0:00:02.959000 -- 'Cause i'm guessingyou didn't say you were flying around in the arms of some kid from school.\n",
      "627: 0:00:01.900000 -- I said i was going to the library.\n",

      "637: 0:00:01.559000 -- are the ones that make you look bad.\n",
      "638: 0:00:02 -- What else is it that your dad doesn't want you to do?\n",

      "151: 0:00:01.765000 -- He got inside her head somehow.\n",
      "152: 0:00:01.700000 -- I don't know how he did it, but I think it's all connected.\n",
      "153: 0:00:00.600000 -- To Kaito.\n",
      "154: 0:00:01.200000 -- To your mother.\n",
      "155: 0:00:02 -- It could be dangerous.\n",
      "156: 0:00:02 -- I can take care of myself.\n",
      "157: 0:00:02.600000 -- Listen, I have to do this.\n",
      "158: 0:00:02.100000 -- Let me come with you.\n",
      "159: 0:00:01.200000 -- Fine.\n",
      "160: 0:00:01.600000 -- We can probably get there faster.\n",
      "161: 0:00:01.800000 -- You know, 'cause you can, uh...\n",
      "162: 0:00:01.400000 -- I'm not a cargo jet, Parkman.\n",
      "163: 0:00:01.500000 -- Oh, please.\n",
      "164: 0:00:01.800000 -- I need to talk to him.\n",
      "165: 0:00:01.600000 -- Alone.\n",
      "166: 0:00:01.900000 -- Tell him what you told me.\n",
      "167: 0:00:01.900000 -- This American girl...\n",
      "168: 0:00:02.150000 -- she's hitting all the boys on the dock,\n",
      "169: 0:00:02.115000 -- looking for a certain shipping container.\n",
      "170: 0:00:01.365000 -- She say what she wanted?\n",
      "171: 0:00:01.300000 -- Yeah.\n",
      "172: 0:00:01.500000 -- You.\n",
      "173: 0:00:01.600000 -- No worries, boyo.\n",
      "174: 0:00:01.400000 -- I think I can help.\n",
      "175: 0:00:01.065000 -- This is my problem.\n",
      "176: 0:00:03.600000 -- Not given what I just saw between you and my sister.\n",
      "177: 0:00:02 -- You care about her, don't you?\n",
      "178: 0:00:02.900000 -- Right now, she's the only thing in my life that means something.\n",
      "179: 0:00:02.465000 -- Caitlin has a flat up the hill.\n",
      "180: 0:00:02.300000 -- Go there and stay until I call you.\n",
      "181: 0:00:01.550000 -- I'll take care of your friend.\n",
      "182: 0:00:01.515000 -- I could handle this myself.\n",
      "183: 0:00:01.365000 -- I don't doubt it.\n",
      "184: 0:00:01.900000 -- I've seen what you can do.\n",
      "185: 0:00:02.600000 -- But I've got an investment in you now.\n",
      "186: 0:00:03.600000 -- Some little blonde's isn't going to scare me off.\n",
      "187: 0:00:01.200000 -- Now go on.\n",
      "188: 0:00:02.300000 -- And don't be telling caitlin about any of this.\n",
      "189: 0:00:02.065000 -- She'll only worry sick.\n",
      "190: 0:00:01.500000 -- Monica.\n",
      "191: 0:00:01.500000 -- Well?\n",
      "192: 0:00:01.365000 -- Well, what?\n",
      "193: 0:00:02.465000 -- Well, are you gonna tell me what that was all about?\n",
      "194: 0:00:02.800000 -- Uh, I just didn't want some crackhead looking for revenge.\n",
      "195: 0:00:01 -- So I said I didn't recognize him.\n",
      "196: 0:00:01.065000 -- No, not that.\n",
      "197: 0:00:04 -- I'm talking about the whole flying-karate-kick thing.\n",
      "198: 0:00:02.730000 -- Oh... that.\n",
      "199: 0:00:03.200000 -- Mr. Lamont said he has never seen anything like it.\n",
      "200: 0:00:02.500000 -- How did you do that?\n",
      "201: 0:00:04.200000 -- More importantly, why did you do that?\n",
      "202: 0:00:01.965000 -- I don't know.\n",
      "203: 0:00:02.900000 -- I don't know anything anymore.\n",
      "204: 0:00:02.200000 -- Nothing makes any sense.\n",
      "205: 0:00:01.300000 -- Well...\n",
      "206: 0:00:02.300000 -- where did you learn how to...\n",
      "207: 0:00:04.700000 -- I think... I think on tv.\n",
      "208: 0:00:03.265000 -- Something is happening to me, Camille.\n",
      "209: 0:00:04.900000 -- My body does things before my brain even knows what's happening.\n",
      "210: 0:00:02.965000 -- That thing with the tomatoes yesterday.\n",
      "211: 0:00:01.665000 -- Now this.\n",
      "212: 0:00:01.700000 -- It's like...\n",
      "213: 0:00:01.800000 -- Like what?\n",
      "214: 0:00:02.700000 -- I was supposed to be somebody, Camille.\n",
      "215: 0:00:04.700000 -- The first person in my family to go to college.\n",
      "216: 0:00:02.500000 -- Now look at me.\n",
      "217: 0:00:01.700000 -- You know what, never mind.\n",
      "218: 0:00:01.265000 -- I've been here since last night.\n",
      "219: 0:00:01.800000 -- I'm just gonna go home and sleep it off.\n",
      "220: 0:00:01.565000 -- Hey, Monica.\n",
      "221: 0:00:02.800000 -- Everything's gonna be okay.\n",
      "222: 0:00:02.300000 -- - Okay? - Yeah\n",
      "223: 0:00:02.100000 -- I hope so.\n",
      "224: 0:00:00.765000 -- All right, this is it.\n",
      "225: 0:00:01.400000 -- This is where Molly said we'd find him.\n",
      "226: 0:00:02.165000 -- What are you planning, exactly?\n",
      "227: 0:00:00.950000 -- I'm not sure.\n",
      "228: 0:00:00.915000 -- You're not sure?\n",
      "229: 0:00:01.600000 -- He traumatized your girl.\n",
      "230: 0:00:01.050000 -- Has my mother terrified.\n",
      "231: 0:00:01.015000 -- You better get sure.\n",
      "232: 0:00:01.500000 -- Get your gun out.\n",
      "233: 0:00:01.200000 -- Come on.\n",
      "234: 0:00:01.150000 -- Hey...\n",
      "235: 0:00:01.115000 -- You okay?\n",
      "236: 0:00:02.900000 -- When I was 13, my father ran out on us.\n",
      "237: 0:00:00.665000 -- I haven't talked to him.\n",
      "238: 0:00:02.365000 -- I haven't seen him.\n",
      "239: 0:00:00.965000 -- I've spent half my life thinking about\n",
      "240: 0:00:01.400000 -- what I'm gonna say to this guy if I ever got the chance.\n",
      "241: 0:00:02.900000 -- And now I can't even knock on the door.\n",
      "242: 0:00:01.665000 -- You're welcome.\n",
      "243: 0:00:01.800000 -- Parkman, this is not a family reunion.\n",
      "244: 0:00:00.630000 -- - I know. - Okay.\n",
      "245: 0:00:01 -- He's not your dad today.\n",
      "246: 0:00:01.432000 -- He is a suspect.\n",
      "247: 0:00:01.398000 -- Get your gun out.\n",
      "248: 0:00:02.200000 -- Police! Open up!\n",
      "249: 0:00:01.165000 -- Who the hell are you?!\n",
      "250: 0:00:01.565000 -- I said who the hell are you?!\n",
      "251: 0:00:01.500000 -- Put the gun down and I'll tell you.\n",
      "252: 0:00:01.500000 -- Parkman.\n",
      "253: 0:00:01.700000 -- Matt?\n",
      "254: 0:00:04.200000 -- Oh, my god. W- what are you doing here?\n",
      "255: 0:00:01.265000 -- Put the gun down.\n",
      "256: 0:00:02.100000 -- Not till you tell me what the hell you're doing here!\n",
      "257: 0:00:03.200000 -- - I want to know what you're doing inside Molly Walker's dreams. - Who?\n",
      "258: 0:00:02.665000 -- And what do you know about Kaito Nakamura's murder?\n",
      "259: 0:00:02.800000 -- And while we're at it, why is Angela Petrelli protecting you?\n",
      "260: 0:00:01.865000 -- Wait! What are you, a cop?\n",
      "261: 0:00:02.800000 -- Right now I'm not, so you better start talking.\n",
      "262: 0:00:01.100000 -- I'm good.\n",
      "263: 0:00:01.500000 -- You got it all wrong.\n",
      "264: 0:00:02.200000 -- That why you're swinging a shotgun?\n",
      "265: 0:00:01.300000 -- Because of that.\n",
      "266: 0:00:02.100000 -- On... on the desk.\n",
      "267: 0:00:02.200000 -- They're gonna kill me too.\n",
      "268: 0:00:01.265000 -- Tell me about Molly Walker.\n",
      "269: 0:00:01.500000 -- She's seen this symbol. She's seen you,\n",
      "270: 0:00:01.500000 -- and she calls you the nightmare man.\n",
      "271: 0:00:00.930000 -- She's looking for me.\n",
      "272: 0:00:02 -- Yeah, and she saw you looking back at her, and now she won't wake up.\n",
      "273: 0:00:01.365000 -- So whatever you did, undo it now.\n",
      "274: 0:00:01.950000 -- Sorry, I'm protecting myself.\n",
      "275: 0:00:02.107000 -- Protecting yourself from who?\n",
      "276: 0:00:02.073000 -- Which one of her kids are you?\n",
      "277: 0:00:02 -- You're the politician, right?\n",
      "278: 0:00:02.700000 -- My mother is sitting in jail for Kaito's murder.\n",
      "279: 0:00:02.065000 -- They both received similar threats.\n",
      "280: 0:00:02.300000 -- Both taken from the same picture.\n",
      "281: 0:00:01.432000 -- The same photograph.\n",
      "282: 0:00:01.398000 -- You were all connected.\n",
      "283: 0:00:01.750000 -- Your folks, Kaito...\n",
      "284: 0:00:01.680000 -- Linderman, me...\n",
      "285: 0:00:02.065000 -- we found each other years ago.\n",
      "286: 0:00:01.500000 -- We-we thought we could help people.\n",
      "287: 0:00:01.330000 -- Save the world.\n",
      "288: 0:00:03.900000 -- The only thing you've ever wanted to save is your own ass.\n",
      "289: 0:00:02.500000 -- Still angry, huh, Matt?\n",
      "290: 0:00:01 -- Feel better?\n",
      "291: 0:00:01.700000 -- Slapping the cuffs on your dad make you feel good?\n",
      "292: 0:00:02.065000 -- Oh, it's starting to, yeah.\n",
      "293: 0:00:01.665000 -- This is a waste of time.\n",
      "294: 0:00:02.100000 -- Just read his mind so we can get the hell out of here.\n",
      "295: 0:00:01.465000 -- What did you say?\n",
      "296: 0:00:01.400000 -- You can...\n",
      "297: 0:00:02.100000 -- read minds?\n",
      "298: 0:00:01.300000 -- Yeah?\n",
      "299: 0:00:01.800000 -- Go ahead.\n",
      "300: 0:00:01.400000 -- Go on.\n",
      "301: 0:00:01.300000 -- God!\n",
      "302: 0:00:01.800000 -- It's painful, isn't it?\n",
      "303: 0:00:01.400000 -- How do you know that?\n",
      "304: 0:00:01.365000 -- Can you read minds too?\n",
      "305: 0:00:03.700000 -- See, Matt, you and I, we're not so different after all.\n",
      "306: 0:00:03.100000 -- Come on, unlock these cuffs.\n",
      "307: 0:00:02.700000 -- I'll tell you everything I know.\n",
      "308: 0:00:01.700000 -- I promise.\n",
      "309: 0:00:02.500000 -- Isn't it wonderful?\n",
      "310: 0:00:03.600000 -- We've got a musician in the house again.\n",
      "311: 0:00:02.600000 -- Nobody's touched that thing since my mother died.\n",
      "312: 0:00:01.565000 -- Oh, I'm sorry.\n",
      "313: 0:00:01 -- Nana said I could, but if-\n",
      "314: 0:00:01.565000 -- Oh, yeah.\n",
      "315: 0:00:01.465000 -- It's okay.\n",
      "316: 0:00:02.100000 -- Please keep playing.\n",
      "317: 0:00:02.100000 -- You must really miss your mom.\n",
      "318: 0:00:02.100000 -- Yeah, I do.\n",
      "319: 0:00:01.800000 -- I miss mine too.\n",
      "320: 0:00:02.700000 -- Oh, I'm sure she's fine.\n",
      "321: 0:00:02.665000 -- And missing you right back.\n",
      "322: 0:00:02.400000 -- She wouldn't even tell me where she was going.\n",
      "323: 0:00:02.965000 -- You gotta remember she cares about you.\n",
      "324: 0:00:02.700000 -- I know new things can be scary.\n",
      "325: 0:00:05.700000 -- My mom always said god doesn't give us anything we can't handle.\n",
      "326: 0:00:01.500000 -- You play piano too?\n",
      "327: 0:00:01.300000 -- No.\n",
      "328: 0:00:01.800000 -- Never learned.\n",
      "329: 0:00:03.900000 -- If you don't play, then what was that?\n",
      "330: 0:00:01 -- Yes?\n",
      "331: 0:00:01.400000 -- I've been trying to reach you for hours.\n",
      "332: 0:00:01.332000 -- Where have you been?\n",
      "333: 0:00:01.298000 -- I'm at work. Why?\n",
      "334: 0:00:01 -- It's Molly.\n",
      "335: 0:00:02.200000 -- She won't wake up, and her vitals are getting worse.\n",
      "336: 0:00:01.600000 -- I'm running out of options here.\n",
      "337: 0:00:01.365000 -- Take her to the hospital.\n",
      "338: 0:00:01.165000 -- And say what?\n",
      "339: 0:00:01.500000 -- That she's trapped in a nightmare?\n",
      "340: 0:00:02.100000 -- No, I am taking her into the company.\n",
      "341: 0:00:01.665000 -- You can't be serious.\n",
      "342: 0:00:01.900000 -- These are the people we're fighting against.\n",
      "343: 0:00:01.430000 -- Molly won't last. Not like this.\n",
      "344: 0:00:02.500000 -- They are the only people who can understand what's happening to her.\n",
      "345: 0:00:01.600000 -- Don't do this.\n",
      "346: 0:00:04.800000 -- The moment you trust them with what you care about most, they'll have you.\n",
      "347: 0:00:02.800000 -- Don't forget whose side you're on.\n",
      "348: 0:00:01.700000 -- I'm on her side.\n",
      "349: 0:00:01.900000 -- All right, you gotta tell us everything.\n",
      "350: 0:00:00.700000 -- Every crime.\n",
      "351: 0:00:01.600000 -- Everyone you've ever worked with.\n",
      "352: 0:00:00.700000 -- Everything.\n",
      "353: 0:00:00.665000 -- I'm so sorry.\n",
      "354: 0:00:01.400000 -- I'm so sorry I left you.\n",
      "355: 0:00:01.365000 -- It wasn't easy for me.\n",
      "356: 0:00:00.565000 -- Don't.\n",
      "357: 0:00:01.500000 -- I need to say it.\n",
      "358: 0:00:03.100000 -- When I found out I could read minds, it was a temptation, I was weak.\n",
      "359: 0:00:02.700000 -- I used people. I was a real scumbag.\n",
      "360: 0:00:02.900000 -- You... a cop.\n",
      "361: 0:00:00.700000 -- I'm so proud.\n",
      "362: 0:00:00.750000 -- You don't get to be proud.\n",
      "363: 0:00:00.907000 -- You don't get to be anything.\n",
      "364: 0:00:00.838000 -- Just answer the questions.\n",
      "365: 0:00:03.300000 -- You said you tried to save the world.\n",
      "366: 0:00:01.030000 -- How?\n",
      "367: 0:00:01.465000 -- These gifts came out of nowhere.\n",
      "368: 0:00:03.700000 -- We just found each other, like we were connected somehow.\n",
      "369: 0:00:01.482000 -- We thought we were invincible.\n",
      "370: 0:00:01.448000 -- A few of us took that to heart.\n",
      "371: 0:00:01.500000 -- They started to do whatever they wanted.\n",
      "372: 0:00:01.865000 -- I did what I could to stop them.\n",
      "373: 0:00:01.465000 -- Like what?\n",
      "374: 0:00:02 -- This thing we can do, you and I.\n",
      "375: 0:00:02.900000 -- It only begins at reading minds.\n",
      "376: 0:00:02.865000 -- And then it becomes so much more.\n",
      "377: 0:00:01.100000 -- More how?\n",
      "378: 0:00:02.500000 -- I... I can't explain it.\n",
      "379: 0:00:01.800000 -- No, hang on.\n",
      "380: 0:00:01.800000 -- I got something I can show you.\n",
      "381: 0:00:01.730000 -- 'Cause it helped me understand it.\n",
      "382: 0:00:02.100000 -- Yeah, I got a bunch of stuff from back then.\n",
      "383: 0:00:01.500000 -- It's... it's in here.\n",
      "384: 0:00:01.765000 -- Oh, come on.\n",
      "385: 0:00:01.200000 -- Matt?\n",
      "386: 0:00:01.500000 -- Matt!\n",
      "387: 0:00:01.300000 -- Dad?\n",
      "388: 0:00:01.700000 -- Hey, what's going on?\n",
      "389: 0:00:02.100000 -- Hey, what the hell's going on?\n",
      "390: 0:00:01.300000 -- Where am I?\n",
      "391: 0:00:02.100000 -- This is impossible.\n",
      "392: 0:00:02.400000 -- We saved the city.\n",
      "393: 0:00:00.750000 -- Let me out!\n",
      "394: 0:00:00.680000 -- It's a mistake.\n",
      "395: 0:00:02.200000 -- I'm not supposed to be here.\n",
      "396: 0:00:03.700000 -- Yeah, no one's supposed to be here.\n",
      "397: 0:00:02.200000 -- Pleasant dreams.\n",
      "398: 0:00:01.300000 -- Monica.\n",
      "399: 0:00:02.900000 -- I think I know what happened with the piano.\n",
      "400: 0:00:00.565000 -- What can I say?\n",
      "401: 0:00:02.800000 -- Guess I'm just a musical genius.\n",
      "402: 0:00:03.165000 -- Or it's something else.\n",
      "403: 0:00:03.200000 -- Look, it's been a hard couple days for me.\n",
      "404: 0:00:03.130000 -- In fact, it's been a hard couple years.\n",
      "405: 0:00:05.300000 -- So I think I'm just gonna take a nice long nap, and sleep it off.\n",
      "406: 0:00:01.565000 -- Monica.\n",
      "407: 0:00:03.500000 -- Do you remember last night when I said I was able to rig the Pay-Per-View on the tv?\n",
      "408: 0:00:01.365000 -- Yeah.\n",
      "409: 0:00:01.900000 -- Well, I lied.\n",
      "410: 0:00:04.865000 -- How did- how did you-\n",
      "411: 0:00:02.700000 -- I think it runs in the family.\n",
      "412: 0:00:04.400000 -- I mean, maybe not exactly like me, but-\n",
      "413: 0:00:03 -- My dad could walk through walls.\n",
      "414: 0:00:01.400000 -- D.L.?\n",
      "415: 0:00:00.965000 -- Yeah.\n",
      "416: 0:00:01.600000 -- And my mom...\n",
      "417: 0:00:02.565000 -- don't even get me started on my mom.\n",
      "418: 0:00:04.100000 -- But I think what's going on with you is more like this.\n",
      "419: 0:00:01.800000 -- A comic book?\n",
      "420: 0:00:01.230000 -- Yeah.\n",
      "421: 0:00:01.400000 -- This is Saint Joan.\n",
      "422: 0:00:01.365000 -- She's a muscle mimic.\n",
      "423: 0:00:01.282000 -- A what?\n",
      "424: 0:00:01.248000 -- A copycat.\n",
      "425: 0:00:02.800000 -- Whatever she sees, she can do.\n",
      "426: 0:00:03.600000 -- That's just like what you did with me and the piano.\n",
      "427: 0:00:02.100000 -- A copycat.\n",
      "428: 0:00:01.700000 -- Copycat.\n",
      "429: 0:00:01.700000 -- Look at this.\n",
      "430: 0:00:02.300000 -- I shouldn't know how to do this.\n",
      "431: 0:00:02.800000 -- I saw it on tv.\n",
      "432: 0:00:02.400000 -- Oh, my god.\n",
      "433: 0:00:05.600000 -- So if this is really happening to you, maybe we ought to go test it out.\n",
      "434: 0:00:01.400000 -- I didn't know where else to go.\n",
      "435: 0:00:01.365000 -- Oh, you made the right choice.\n",
      "436: 0:00:03.600000 -- We're going to do everything we can for Molly.\n",
      "437: 0:00:03.900000 -- In the meantime, we have someone else who needs us.\n",
      "438: 0:00:01.765000 -- And we would like you to bring her in.\n",
      "439: 0:00:01.165000 -- You're sending me into the field?\n",
      "440: 0:00:00.665000 -- Yes.\n",
      "441: 0:00:00.965000 -- Molly needs me here.\n",
      "442: 0:00:02.900000 -- No, no, no. Molly is our top priority here,\n",
      "443: 0:00:04.500000 -- but we need you out there doing the good work you do, helping others like her.\n",
      "444: 0:00:03.600000 -- And, uh, you're gonna need this.\n",
      "445: 0:00:01.700000 -- This is how you help people?\n",
      "446: 0:00:01.630000 -- By tasering them?\n",
      "447: 0:00:03.850000 -- Well, that's just standard procedure to make sure everyone's safe.\n",
      "448: 0:00:03.815000 -- A lot of the people we encounter aren't in control of their abilities.\n",
      "449: 0:00:03.500000 -- But trust me, it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.\n",
      "450: 0:00:02.700000 -- Niki's loose, grab her!\n",
      "451: 0:00:00.565000 -- Down the hall.\n",
      "452: 0:00:01.665000 -- Grab her.\n",
      "453: 0:00:01.400000 -- Niki?\n",
      "454: 0:00:02.800000 -- What the hell is going on here?\n",
      "455: 0:00:02 -- So do you want to try something really rad?\n",
      "456: 0:00:01.665000 -- Like a kick flip?\n",
      "457: 0:00:01.800000 -- Slam dunk?\n",
      "458: 0:00:01.200000 -- Well...\n",
      "459: 0:00:03.100000 -- I always sucked at double dutch.\n",
      "460: 0:00:02.300000 -- You want somethin', lady?\n",
      "461: 0:00:02.800000 -- Yeah. I want to jump in.\n",
      "462: 0:00:01.800000 -- And don't call me lady.\n",
      "463: 0:00:01.500000 -- It's not much.\n",
      "464: 0:00:01.900000 -- I sleep in a pub, remember?\n",
      "465: 0:00:01.200000 -- You paint?\n",
      "466: 0:00:01.700000 -- Well, it's what I do to relax.\n",
      "467: 0:00:01.700000 -- These are amazing.\n",
      "468: 0:00:01 -- You're talented.\n",
      "469: 0:00:01.300000 -- Is that why you kidnapped me?\n",
      "470: 0:00:02.200000 -- So you could sort through me things?\n",
      "471: 0:00:03.300000 -- Don't start liking me less now that you're peeling away the mystery.\n",
      "472: 0:00:01.500000 -- I just...\n",
      "473: 0:00:02.200000 -- wanted to see where you lived.\n",
      "474: 0:00:02 -- Lie on a real bed maybe.\n",
      "475: 0:00:01.900000 -- No one's stopping you.\n",
      "476: 0:00:01.700000 -- What are you looking at?\n",
      "477: 0:00:01.900000 -- Nothing.\n",
      "478: 0:00:02.100000 -- Then what is it that's on your mind?\n",
      "479: 0:00:02.100000 -- You were right.\n",
      "480: 0:00:03.700000 -- Whatever I was, whoever I am...\n",
      "481: 0:00:02.500000 -- I have to face it.\n",
      "482: 0:00:03.300000 -- Nothing that I find in this box is gonna change anything.\n",
      "483: 0:00:04.100000 -- Whatever my life was before, this is where I want to be now.\n",
      "484: 0:00:01.600000 -- With you.\n",
      "485: 0:00:01.700000 -- Okay?\n",
      "486: 0:00:01.500000 -- Okay.\n",
      "487: 0:00:02 -- Get on with it then.\n",
      "488: 0:00:01.800000 -- Peter Petrelli?\n",
      "489: 0:00:02 -- I'm from New York.\n",
      "490: 0:00:01.100000 -- Looks like you were leaving.\n",
      "491: 0:00:02.600000 -- Th this is an open ticket, New York to Montreal.\n",
      "492: 0:00:01.500000 -- Who's that?\n",
      "493: 0:00:01.700000 -- I wish I knew.\n",
      "494: 0:00:02.100000 -- None of this tells me how I got here.\n",
      "495: 0:00:01.600000 -- What I'm supposed to do.\n",
      "496: 0:00:01.100000 -- What is it?\n",
      "497: 0:00:01.100000 -- Peter?\n",
      "498: 0:00:01.800000 -- Oh, my god, Peter!\n",
      "499: 0:00:03.100000 -- You know, I've never been in an Irish pub before.\n",
      "500: 0:00:01.900000 -- Do you have Haggis?\n",
      "501: 0:00:01.600000 -- That's Scotland, love.\n",
      "502: 0:00:01.600000 -- We have stew.\n",
      "503: 0:00:01.600000 -- And muscles.\n",
      "504: 0:00:01.200000 -- And stew.\n",
      "505: 0:00:01.200000 -- But I'm closing up.\n",
      "506: 0:00:02.200000 -- Oh, well...\n",
      "507: 0:00:02.200000 -- yeah, I was hoping you could help me.\n",
      "508: 0:00:02.100000 -- I'm looking for a guy.\n",
      "509: 0:00:02.400000 -- Best time for that's right after a football match.\n",
      "510: 0:00:02.200000 -- The fellas are locked out of their minds.\n",
      "511: 0:00:02 -- Up for anything.\n",
      "512: 0:00:02.200000 -- His name is Peter Petrelli.\n",
      "513: 0:00:01.800000 -- Never seen him before.\n",
      "514: 0:00:01.700000 -- Never seen him before?\n",
      "515: 0:00:01.200000 -- No.\n",
      "516: 0:00:01.800000 -- Cool. Thanks.\n",
      "517: 0:00:05 -- The thing is, I talked to a few people from the docks.\n",
      "518: 0:00:02.200000 -- They said they saw him in here.\n",
      "519: 0:00:02.500000 -- I don't know what to tell you.\n",
      "520: 0:00:04.200000 -- So either you're lying, or all those other people are lying.\n",
      "521: 0:00:03.100000 -- It's just kinda hard to tell who's lying, you know?\n",
      "522: 0:00:01 -- Like I said...\n",
      "523: 0:00:01.900000 -- I don't know this Peter.\n",
      "524: 0:00:01.800000 -- That it now?\n",
      "525: 0:00:01.800000 -- I guess so.\n",
      "526: 0:00:01.700000 -- Sorry I couldn't be more help.\n",
      "527: 0:00:01.200000 -- Yeah.\n",
      "528: 0:00:02.100000 -- So am I.\n",
      "529: 0:00:02.400000 -- You gave us quite a scare.\n",
      "530: 0:00:02.200000 -- I'm sorry about earlier.\n",
      "531: 0:00:01.800000 -- I'm feeling much better now.\n",
      "532: 0:00:01 -- Thank you.\n",
      "533: 0:00:02 -- We knew it wouldn't be easy.\n",
      "534: 0:00:03 -- Multiple-personality disorder is a terrible affliction,\n",
      "535: 0:00:02.500000 -- but we're gonna get you well again.\n",
      "536: 0:00:01.700000 -- I promise.\n",
      "537: 0:00:01.800000 -- Thank you.\n",
      "538: 0:00:00.700000 -- I'm gonna get you out of here.\n",
      "539: 0:00:00.900000 -- I can't leave.\n",
      "540: 0:00:01.600000 -- Niki, you're a prisoner.\n",
      "541: 0:00:01.700000 -- I'm not.\n",
      "542: 0:00:01.600000 -- I came here on my own.\n",
      "543: 0:00:02.100000 -- I gave up my son to be here.\n",
      "544: 0:00:01.600000 -- I'm sick.\n",
      "545: 0:00:03.400000 -- I didn't think anyone could ever understand my problems.\n",
      "546: 0:00:01.500000 -- What I've done.\n",
      "547: 0:00:02.300000 -- What I'm capable of.\n",
      "548: 0:00:02.100000 -- These are the only people that can help me.\n",
      "549: 0:00:01.100000 -- Nathan.\n",
      "550: 0:00:01 -- Peter?\n",
      "551: 0:00:00.900000 -- Peter!\n",
      "552: 0:00:01.300000 -- Peter, I knew it.\n",
      "553: 0:00:02.200000 -- I knew you could survive\n",
      "554: 0:00:01.500000 -- You.\n",
      "555: 0:00:02.200000 -- You can't run from me, Nathan.\n",
      "556: 0:00:00.900000 -- Baby.\n",
      "557: 0:00:02.200000 -- Hey, you've gotta get this baby out of here!\n",
      "558: 0:00:01.300000 -- Hey!\n",
      "559: 0:00:01.200000 -- Janice?\n",
      "560: 0:00:01.500000 -- What are you doing in here?\n",
      "561: 0:00:01.700000 -- Is that-\n",
      "562: 0:00:00.900000 -- Janice...\n",
      "563: 0:00:01.600000 -- is that baby mine?\n",
      "564: 0:00:01.400000 -- You said I wasn't the father.\n",
      "565: 0:00:01.800000 -- But you read minds.\n",
      "566: 0:00:03.500000 -- You looked into my head and you saw the truth, but you still left.\n",
      "567: 0:00:01.600000 -- No.\n",
      "568: 0:00:01.600000 -- No, I didn't. I didn't know.\n",
      "569: 0:00:01.600000 -- You left him.\n",
      "570: 0:00:01.800000 -- Just like your father left you.\n",
      "571: 0:00:02 -- Just like you're gonna leave Molly.\n",
      "572: 0:00:01.200000 -- No.\n",
      "573: 0:00:01.200000 -- No, Janice.\n",
      "574: 0:00:01.200000 -- Janice! Hey-\n",
      "575: 0:00:01.300000 -- You're no hero.\n",
      "576: 0:00:01.700000 -- Everybody's dead because of you.\n",
      "577: 0:00:00.800000 -- We have to stop it.\n",
      "578: 0:00:01.600000 -- You can't.\n",
      "579: 0:00:01.300000 -- You don't want redemption.\n",
      "580: 0:00:01.500000 -- You want ignorance.\n",
      "581: 0:00:01.400000 -- Let's go over the edge.\n",
      "582: 0:00:01.700000 -- You won't feel anything.\n",
      "583: 0:00:01.600000 -- You never do.\n",
      "584: 0:00:01.300000 -- You don't know me.\n",
      "585: 0:00:01.700000 -- I am you.\n",
      "586: 0:00:01.500000 -- Stop it, Nathan!\n",
      "587: 0:00:01.400000 -- Nathan, wake up!\n",

      "276: 0:00:03.833000 -- But i know how that sounds.\n",
      "277: 0:00:02.966000 -- The truth is, they will.\n",

      "286: 0:00:03.033000 -- Until one day you discovered you could do\n",
      "287: 0:00:01.833000 -- Incredible things.\n",
      "288: 0:00:03.334000 -- I bet it was wonderful at first.\n",
      "289: 0:00:02.401000 -- You thought perhaps you could save the world.\n",
      "290: 0:00:03.533000 -- And then you realized, tragically,\n",
      "291: 0:00:02.533000 -- That you were dangerous.\n",
      "292: 0:00:04.668000 -- I'll let you talk to me after a decade.\n",

      "172: 0:00:01.590000 -- He froze time.\n",
      "173: 0:00:01.890000 -- Said he knew you.\n",
      "174: 0:00:01.970000 -- We were friends once.\n",
      "175: 0:00:01.810000 -- A very long time ago.\n",
      "176: 0:00:02.040000 -- He tried to kill you.\n",
      "177: 0:00:01.230000 -- He said I shouldn't trust you.\n",
      "178: 0:00:02.020000 -- And what did you think about that?\n",
      "179: 0:00:01.590000 -- Let's go destroy the virus.\n",
      "180: 0:00:01.430000 -- Right.\n",
      "181: 0:00:02.380000 -- I believe this is mine, Carp.\n",
      "182: 0:00:04.050000 -- Dad left records of pretty much everything he did for the company.\n",
      "183: 0:00:02.410000 -- You are really going through with this.\n",
      "184: 0:00:02.220000 -- They killed dad. They're never gonna leave us alone.\n",
      "185: 0:00:04.650000 -- You do realize what'll happen to us if you tell everyone what you can do.\n",
      "186: 0:00:01.420000 -- Yes.\n",
      "187: 0:00:03.720000 -- No more running. No more hiding. No more secrets.\n",
      "188: 0:00:01.910000 -- Your father couldn't take down this company,Claire.\n",
      "189: 0:00:02.500000 -- What makes you think you can?\n",
      "190: 0:00:02.980000 -- I don't know if you can understand it.\n",
      "191: 0:00:03.220000 -- They only target people with abilities.\n",
      "192: 0:00:02.200000 -- People like me.\n",
      "193: 0:00:02.520000 -- You are still my daughter,Claire.\n",
      "194: 0:00:03.310000 -- I dream about you going to college,getting married someday.\n",
      "195: 0:00:02.340000 -- What if they take you from me...\n",
      "196: 0:00:03.460000 -- Use you in some lab experiment?\n",
      "197: 0:00:02.140000 -- I love you,mom.\n",
      "198: 0:00:03.260000 -- But I can't live in fear of some big \"What if?\"\n",
      "199: 0:00:03.610000 -- Do you realize how much damage you've done by provoking Claire?\n",
      "200: 0:00:01.670000 -- I couldn't help it.\n",
      "201: 0:00:05.060000 -- She was just so... weepy and earnest and...\n",
      "202: 0:00:01.710000 -- Who knew she'd turn whistle-blower?\n",
      "203: 0:00:02.860000 -- It's totally unprofessional, not to mention petty.\n",
      "204: 0:00:02.610000 -- And Claire is not even in your league!\n",
      "205: 0:00:02.470000 -- She isn't working with a gunshot wound.\n",
      "206: 0:00:04.940000 -- You and I both know you have performed well below what you can do.\n",
      "207: 0:00:01.920000 -- You're benched.\n",
      "208: 0:00:02.420000 -- No more field assignments.\n",
      "209: 0:00:03.740000 -- How's about if I said I was sorry?\n",
      "210: 0:00:05.080000 -- When I think about all the hard work I put into raising you...\n",
      "211: 0:00:01.680000 -- Daddy...\n",
      "212: 0:00:02.570000 -- You said you knew all about my ability.\n",
      "213: 0:00:02.640000 -- Tell me what my dad did to me.\n",
      "214: 0:00:01.700000 -- I'm stuck in this hell-hole.\n",
      "215: 0:00:01.500000 -- My family thinks I'm dead.\n",
      "216: 0:00:02.850000 -- There's not a lot of incentive to share.\n",
      "217: 0:00:02.380000 -- I could make you tell me.\n",
      "218: 0:00:01.840000 -- You could try.\n",
      "219: 0:00:01.550000 -- Please.\n",
      "220: 0:00:02.880000 -- I don't have anyone else to talk to.\n",
      "221: 0:00:03.680000 -- They wanted to see how much wattage you could discharge.\n",
      "222: 0:00:05.570000 -- Enough to power a flashlight, street lamp,an entire city block?\n",
      "223: 0:00:03.370000 -- During testing,you'd pass out from the strain.\n",
      "224: 0:00:01.540000 -- We'd all want to call it a day,but daddy said,\n",
      "225: 0:00:02.900000 -- \"No,my girl's tougher than that.\"\n",
      "226: 0:00:02.270000 -- You were seven.\n",
      "227: 0:00:03.450000 -- You know,the hardest thing a parent ever does\n",
      "228: 0:00:03.464000 -- is to have to see their child in pain.\n",
      "229: 0:00:01.880000 -- Most parents.\n",
      "230: 0:00:01.370000 -- Elle.\n",
      "231: 0:00:02.390000 -- What are you doing here?\n",
      "232: 0:00:01.630000 -- Leaving.\n",
      "233: 0:00:02.590000 -- Noah,we have a problem.\n",
      "234: 0:00:01.990000 -- I'm not part of your \"We. \"\n",
      "235: 0:00:01.760000 -- Do you remember?\n",
      "236: 0:00:02.340000 -- This is about Claire.\n",
      "237: 0:00:02.880000 -- She's becoming difficult.\n",
      "238: 0:00:01.970000 -- Is she?\n",
      "239: 0:00:03.220000 -- I need to know if she could possibly have any hard evidence\n",
      "240: 0:00:03.100000 -- Which could leave this company exposed.\n",
      "241: 0:00:01.020000 -- That's unfortunate.\n",
      "242: 0:00:03.580000 -- Because now we're going to have to take measures to keep your daughter quiet.\n",
      "243: 0:00:02.443000 -- - Mom! - Micah! Where have you been?\n",
      "244: 0:00:01.550000 -- I've been looking everywhere for you.\n",
      "245: 0:00:02.400000 -- Monica tried to get my stuff back that was stolen.\n",
      "246: 0:00:01.510000 -- Dad's medal,my comics.\n",
      "247: 0:00:01.970000 -- I told you to let the police handle it.\n",
      "248: 0:00:01.390000 -- She got caught.\n",
      "249: 0:00:01.050000 -- I'm calling the police.\n",
      "250: 0:00:02.050000 -- You can call them after we find her.\n",
      "251: 0:00:01.380000 -- She was taken in a red van.\n",
      "252: 0:00:01.330000 -- We have to rescue her.\n",
      "253: 0:00:01.950000 -- - With your super strength- - Micah,stop.\n",
      "254: 0:00:02.170000 -- I don't have my strength anymore.\n",
      "255: 0:00:00.900000 -- What?\n",
      "256: 0:00:02.710000 -- The virus- It has side effects.\n",
      "257: 0:00:02.490000 -- But it's okay. I got a call from Dr. Suresh.\n",
      "258: 0:00:01.530000 -- He maybe found a cure.\n",
      "259: 0:00:02.170000 -- He's on his way here to make me better.\n",
      "260: 0:00:01.540000 -- I hope so.\n",
      "261: 0:00:02.040000 -- But right now, Monica needs my help.\n",
      "262: 0:00:02.370000 -- So all you have to do is drive.\n",
      "263: 0:00:02.500000 -- Warning. Security breach.\n",
      "264: 0:00:02.480000 -- Unauthorized personnel in the area.\n",
      "265: 0:00:01.900000 -- I believe it's up to the left.\n",
      "266: 0:00:02.230000 -- Oh,please. It's been 30 years.\n",
      "267: 0:00:02.260000 -- Warning security breach.\n",
      "268: 0:00:02.310000 -- - Unauthorized personnel in the area. - Take care of that,will you?\n",
      "269: 0:00:01.500000 -- So what do we do now?\n",
      "270: 0:00:03.120000 -- I guess you'll have to pry it open with that brain of yours.\n",
      "271: 0:00:02.100000 -- I'm not sure I have that sort of power.\n",
      "272: 0:00:04.920000 -- There's not much at stake here- Just the fate of the entire human race.\n",
      "273: 0:00:01.940000 -- Did you kill Hiro's father?\n",
      "274: 0:00:01.240000 -- I did.\n",
      "275: 0:00:02.260000 -- He saw to it that the virus be safely kept here.\n",
      "276: 0:00:02.850000 -- If he didn't plan to use it,why not destroy it?\n",
      "277: 0:00:01.980000 -- Why don't you make me believe you,Adam.\n",
      "278: 0:00:01.140000 -- Hiro said not to trust you.\n",
      "279: 0:00:02.500000 -- The woman you love is trapped in some\n",
      "280: 0:00:02.509000 -- horrible future where nearly everyone's dead.\n",
      "281: 0:00:02.180000 -- You can change that.\n",
      "282: 0:00:02.040000 -- She needs you,Peter.\n",
      "283: 0:00:03.140000 -- We all need you... to open that door.\n",
      "284: 0:00:02.140000 -- Hey you're nothing like you said you were.\n",
      "285: 0:00:01.980000 -- Alejandro was right about you all along.\n",
      "286: 0:00:02.790000 -- You wanna get rid of your powers,I want mine back.\n",
      "287: 0:00:04.130000 -- After Suresh fixes me,I'll gladly take yours off your hands.\n",
      "288: 0:00:01.700000 -- There's a bed over there.\n",
      "289: 0:00:01.050000 -- Stay put.\n",
      "290: 0:00:01.460000 -- Stay calm.\n",
      "291: 0:00:01.670000 -- And remember...\n",
      "292: 0:00:01.250000 -- Mohinder.\n",
      "293: 0:00:02.270000 -- It'll be okay, Molly,I promise.\n",
      "294: 0:00:03.420000 -- So this is your... laboratory,huh?\n",
      "295: 0:00:04.050000 -- I killed that artist,Isaac Mendez, right on this very spot.\n",
      "296: 0:00:01.860000 -- I'm going to have to take a sample of your blood.\n",
      "297: 0:00:01.140000 -- Why?\n",
      "298: 0:00:01.570000 -- You self-diagnosed.\n",
      "299: 0:00:02.340000 -- I need to know what strain of the virus you have.\n",
      "300: 0:00:01.170000 -- Or if you even have it at all.\n",
      "301: 0:00:01.190000 -- Just give me the remedy.\n",
      "302: 0:00:01.500000 -- Doesn't work like that.\n",
      "303: 0:00:01.740000 -- The wrong dosage will kill you.\n",
      "304: 0:00:01.690000 -- Your father helped me find my gift.\n",
      "305: 0:00:01.380000 -- Now here you are restoring it.\n",
      "306: 0:00:01.960000 -- Life has its poetry,doesn't it?\n",
      "307: 0:00:01.210000 -- My father who you murdered.\n",
      "308: 0:00:02.080000 -- Your father who betrayed me.\n",
      "309: 0:00:02.180000 -- Don't make that same mistake,Mohinder.\n",
      "310: 0:00:04.270000 -- Does Suresh know you have him on video surveillance?\n",
      "311: 0:00:01.220000 -- Sylar.\n",
      "312: 0:00:02.410000 -- Oh,daddy,you're gonna be so proud of me.\n",
      "313: 0:00:00.980000 -- Where am I?\n",
      "314: 0:00:01.280000 -- That doesn't matter.\n",
      "315: 0:00:02.450000 -- Both you and it are about to get country fried.\n",
      "316: 0:00:01.190000 -- Please,let me go!\n",
      "317: 0:00:02.540000 -- I swear,I was only trying to help somebody!\n",
      "318: 0:00:03.140000 -- You should've thought about that before you started messing up my business.\n",
      "319: 0:00:02.390000 -- So you thought you was gonna be a hero,huh?\n",
      "320: 0:00:02.540000 -- You know what happens to heroes in the real world?\n",
      "321: 0:00:01.560000 -- They end up dead...\n",
      "322: 0:00:01.580000 -- Just like you.\n",
      "323: 0:00:01.350000 -- Turn left here.\n",
      "324: 0:00:01.880000 -- Explain to me how that works.\n",
      "325: 0:00:03.440000 -- Monica has a cell phone,and the battery emits a tiny GPS signal\n",
      "326: 0:00:02.610000 -- Which I can use to try and get her position.\n",
      "327: 0:00:03.740000 -- Basically,I told your cell phone to find her cell phone and show me where it is.\n",
      "328: 0:00:01.430000 -- You told the phone.\n",
      "329: 0:00:01.280000 -- Yeah.\n",
      "330: 0:00:02.180000 -- Don't slow down. The light will change.\n",
      "331: 0:00:01.030000 -- Let me guess.\n",
      "332: 0:00:01.540000 -- You told it to?\n",
      "333: 0:00:01.960000 -- Slow down,slow down,slow down!\n",
      "334: 0:00:01.030000 -- Okay...\n",
      "335: 0:00:02.210000 -- We don't talk about that ever again.\n",
      "336: 0:00:01.150000 -- Agreed.\n",
      "337: 0:00:03.160000 -- Look,before we go in,I need to know something.\n",
      "338: 0:00:02.400000 -- Is Peter as dangerous as he was in Kirby Plaza?\n",
      "339: 0:00:01.370000 -- You know,with the whole-Puhh!\n",
      "340: 0:00:02.690000 -- I haven't seen him since that night,but I trust him with my life,Parkman.\n",
      "341: 0:00:02.100000 -- Yeah,but your mother...\n",
      "342: 0:00:04.310000 -- Your mother told me that if I had to, that I should kill Peter.\n",
      "343: 0:00:02.400000 -- Listening to my mother has never led to anything good.\n",
      "344: 0:00:02.510000 -- If Peter becomes a problem,I'll handle him.\n",
      "345: 0:00:01.690000 -- Flying man!\n",
      "346: 0:00:02.180000 -- Who's this guy supposed to be?\n",
      "347: 0:00:01.210000 -- Oh,good,you're here.\n",
      "348: 0:00:01.220000 -- Uh,so these two boxes are done.\n",
      "349: 0:00:01.430000 -- They can go in the car.\n",
      "350: 0:00:02.960000 -- I didn't come to help you,Claire.\n",
      "351: 0:00:02.070000 -- I came to stop you.\n",
      "352: 0:00:02.500000 -- These people ruined my life.\n",
      "353: 0:00:01.730000 -- - Your life. - No.\n",
      "354: 0:00:01.230000 -- They didn't.\n",
      "355: 0:00:02.920000 -- But what you're about to do- I'm pretty sure that will.\n",
      "356: 0:00:02.760000 -- West,you're the one who said that we were special,\n",
      "357: 0:00:02.160000 -- That the rules didn't apply to us.\n",
      "358: 0:00:01.730000 -- I think you misunderstood me.\n",
      "359: 0:00:03.060000 -- If we show everyone what we can do,they'll listen to us.\n",
      "360: 0:00:01.420000 -- I can't.\n",
      "361: 0:00:02.080000 -- I like my secrets.\n",
      "362: 0:00:04.630000 -- And I liked finding in you, someone who I could share that with.\n",
      "363: 0:00:02.530000 -- But after you go public,it's all gone.\n",
      "364: 0:00:02.800000 -- You saw what they did to my dad.\n",
      "365: 0:00:02.640000 -- This is the only way to beat them.\n",
      "366: 0:00:03.620000 -- Exposing us, isn't going to bring him back.\n",
      "367: 0:00:01.410000 -- Fine.\n",
      "368: 0:00:01.030000 -- Here's your file.\n",
      "369: 0:00:01.940000 -- It's everything they have on you.\n",
      "370: 0:00:02.230000 -- Now there isn't an \"Us\" for you to be worried about.\n",
      "371: 0:00:01.760000 -- Claire,please,don't do this.\n",
      "372: 0:00:02.680000 -- You won't leave me, will you,Mr. Muggles?\n",
      "373: 0:00:01.840000 -- Hello, Claire-Bear.\n",
      "374: 0:00:02.320000 -- I wish Alejandro was here to help.\n",
      "375: 0:00:01.080000 -- Who's that?\n",
      "376: 0:00:01.710000 -- He's my brother.\n",
      "377: 0:00:01.760000 -- I sent him away.\n",
      "378: 0:00:03.160000 -- Gabriel said-\n",
      "379: 0:00:02.030000 -- I can find him for you.\n",
