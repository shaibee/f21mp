      "322: 0:00:02.856000 -- Well, we'll see.\n",
      "323: 0:00:04.864000 -- The company was formed 30 years ago with a group of like-minded individuals,\n",
      "324: 0:00:04.417000 -- ordinary men and women who were gifted with extraordinary powers.\n",
      "325: 0:00:02.314000 -- They wanted to help their own.\n",

      "331: 0:00:03.694000 -- And teaching them to use their abilities for the good of mankind.\n",
      "332: 0:00:02.621000 -- And sometimes it can mean\n",
      "333: 0:00:01.366000 -- eliminating them.\n",
      "334: 0:00:02.536000 -- Who the hell are you to judge who lives and who dies?\n",
      "335: 0:00:01.603000 -- If i'm not mistaken,\n",
      "336: 0:00:03.873000 -- you yourself tried to put a bullet in the brain of a man named Sylar.\n",
      "337: 0:00:02.007000 -- - He was a monster. - Yes.\n",

      "342: 0:00:01.839000 -- And now you have Molly.\n",
      "343: 0:00:03.861000 -- You and Matt Parkman are protecting her.\n",
      "344: 0:00:03.037000 -- Now we're not interfering with that arrangement.\n",

      "352: 0:00:03.196000 -- and crossed over into the general population?\n",
      "353: 0:00:03.950000 -- Look, the type of research you're talking about is extremely expensive.\n",
      "354: 0:00:02.720000 -- Trust me. That won't be a problem.\n",
      "355: 0:00:03.859000 -- Let's just say we have our own private fort knox.\n",
      "356: 0:00:03.338000 -- So can we count you in?\n",

      "360: 0:00:03.338000 -- Well, that is why I got you a vegetable pizza, smarty-pants.\n",
      "361: 0:00:01.960000 -- Plus I got your favorite rocky road for desert.\n",
      "362: 0:00:02.367000 -- You're just trying to bribe me 'cause you never cook.\n",
      "363: 0:00:03.840000 -- - I miss mohinder. He cooks. - Hey, I can cook.\n",
      "364: 0:00:02.984000 -- I just thought why not order pizza? Give us time to talk.\n",
      "365: 0:00:02.186000 -- Talk about what? This?\n",
      "366: 0:00:02.382000 -- Does that mean you passed your detective's exam?\n",
      "367: 0:00:01.899000 -- With flying colors. Why? You proud of me?\n",
      "368: 0:00:01.959000 -- Depends. Did you cheat?\n",
      "369: 0:00:01.300000 -- Why would you ask me that?\n",
      "370: 0:00:02.989000 -- Reading the answers out of people's minds, it's unfair.\n",
      "371: 0:00:02.361000 -- No, it is my natural talent.\n",
      "372: 0:00:02.899000 -- You wouldn't think a baseball player's cheating cause he's athletic, would you?\n",
      "373: 0:00:02.710000 -- It's not the same and you know it.\n",
      "374: 0:00:01 -- You know what,\n",
      "375: 0:00:01.895000 -- I want to talk to you about these drawings that you made at school.\n",

      "377: 0:00:03.652000 -- You don't want to talk about your exams, i don't want to talk about dreams.\n",
      "378: 0:00:01.440000 -- I want to help you.\n",
      "379: 0:00:03.489000 -- - I don't want you to be- - I said I didn't want to talk about it!\n",
      "380: 0:00:02.129000 -- Can I finish my dinner in my room?\n",
      "381: 0:00:01.404000 -- Sure. Go ahead.\n",
      "382: 0:00:02.054000 -- This book is incredible, Alejandro.\n",

      "384: 0:00:02.372000 -- if he knows the cause, there has to be a cure.\n",
      "385: 0:00:03.524000 -- Yes, it's just that. God would not have done this to me...\n",
      "386: 0:00:02.203000 -- without a chance for salvation.\n",
      "387: 0:00:03.121000 -- Maya, it's not your fault.\n",

      "389: 0:00:01.625000 -- You keep saying that...\n",
      "390: 0:00:02.789000 -- but your words don't make it any easier, Alejandro.\n",
      "391: 0:00:01.846000 -- Especially when I know what can happen.\n",
      "392: 0:00:01.439000 -- Nothing will happen.\n",
      "393: 0:00:02.734000 -- Not when I'm with you. I won't let it happen.\n",
      "394: 0:00:01.467000 -- Why did we stop?\n",
      "395: 0:00:01.163000 -- You guys.\n",

      "401: 0:00:01.266000 -- ten thousand...\n",
      "402: 0:00:01.189000 -- for each of you.\n",
      "403: 0:00:02.039000 -- I remenber it was for both of us.\n",
      "404: 0:00:01.868000 -- Pardon me. I made a mistake.\n",
      "405: 0:00:01.282000 -- What I meant was...\n",
      "406: 0:00:01.642000 -- that you ride in the back...\n",
      "407: 0:00:02.842000 -- and your sister rides up front with me.\n",
      "408: 0:00:01.846000 -- I told you she stays with me.\n",
      "409: 0:00:03.526000 -- That's it... the deal, take it or leave it.\n",
      "410: 0:00:01.560000 -- You son of a bitch.\n",
      "411: 0:00:02.982000 -- You don't understand... for God's sake!\n",

      "422: 0:00:02.437000 -- You don't want people to know that you are smart.\n",
      "423: 0:00:02.483000 -- You just have me all figured out, huh?\n",
      "424: 0:00:01.758000 -- Know a robot when I see one.\n",
      "425: 0:00:03.270000 -- Come on, Martha. It's just a back flip off the tower.\n",
      "426: 0:00:02.483000 -- And you know the girls will catch you.\n",
      "427: 0:00:01.358000 -- Just leave her alone, okay?\n",

      "433: 0:00:01.142000 -- What's the big deal?\n",
      "434: 0:00:02.390000 -- If it's so easy, why don't you try it?\n",
      "435: 0:00:03.794000 -- In fact, if you can do a back tuck off the tower,\n",
      "436: 0:00:01.743000 -- Martha here is off the hook.\n",
      "437: 0:00:02.074000 -- All right. I'll do it.\n",

      "441: 0:00:01.220000 -- Can't do it.\n",
      "442: 0:00:01.560000 -- There's a shocker.\n",
      "443: 0:00:01.128000 -- <i>Help me!</i>\n",

      "104: 0:00:04.930000 -- And I think sometimes I don't appreciate how difficult that must be.\n",
      "105: 0:00:03.430000 -- So if you have anything you want to ask me,\n",
      "106: 0:00:04.990000 -- as long as we're in the privacy of our own home, please, ask away.\n",
      "107: 0:00:04.790000 -- If someone here found out about me, what would happen?\n",
      "108: 0:00:02.280000 -- We'd have to leave California immediately.\n",
      "109: 0:00:02.330000 -- Go deeper into hiding.\n",
      "110: 0:00:03.570000 -- Maybe forgo schools and jobs altogether.\n",
      "111: 0:00:02.770000 -- That's worst case scenario.\n",
      "112: 0:00:01.770000 -- It was a pedicure.\n",
      "113: 0:00:01.410000 -- I'm sorry.\n",
      "114: 0:00:00.710000 -- The other night.\n",
      "115: 0:00:01.080000 -- That's what I was doing.\n",
      "116: 0:00:01.910000 -- I was giving myself a pedicure.\n",
      "117: 0:00:02.110000 -- You're not very good at it.\n",
      "118: 0:00:02.500000 -- What is it with you creeping around my house at night anyway?\n",
      "119: 0:00:01.350000 -- Just tryin' to lend you a book.\n",
      "120: 0:00:03.050000 -- Okay, you know what, if I want to start a book club with you, I'll let you know.\n",
      "121: 0:00:01.520000 -- Until then, just stay away from me.\n",
      "122: 0:00:00.530000 -- Will do.\n",
      "123: 0:00:01.380000 -- Just walk me through this one last time.\n",
      "124: 0:00:01.780000 -- I didn't see you cut off your toe, is that right?\n",
      "125: 0:00:03.210000 -- The bottle of nail polish fell over and it just looked like it was bleeding.\n",
      "126: 0:00:01.690000 -- Improvising is really not your forte.\n",
      "127: 0:00:01.420000 -- Why are you such a smart-ass?\n",
      "128: 0:00:01.590000 -- Why are you so bad at lying?\n",
      "129: 0:00:01.290000 -- I'm not lying.\n",
      "130: 0:00:01.830000 -- Fine then. You gave yourself a pedicure.\n",
      "131: 0:00:01.820000 -- And your toe came off and then came back on.\n",
      "132: 0:00:01 -- Works for me.\n",
      "133: 0:00:01.900000 -- I'm going to class.\n",
      "134: 0:00:02.290000 -- Don't do your nails on the way.\n",
      "135: 0:00:00.980000 -- Freeze!\n",
      "136: 0:00:01.410000 -- Oh, for god's sake.\n",
      "137: 0:00:00.840000 -- Mohinder.\n",
      "138: 0:00:00.680000 -- Quiet down.\n",
      "139: 0:00:00.740000 -- You'll wake Molly.\n",
      "140: 0:00:01.760000 -- What are you doing home? I thought you were in Cairo.\n",
      "141: 0:00:00.980000 -- Haiti, actually.\n",
      "142: 0:00:01.450000 -- My plane got in a couple of hours ago.\n",
      "143: 0:00:01.780000 -- I'll be working here in the city from now on.\n",
      "144: 0:00:01.270000 -- I thought you were in the field.\n",
      "145: 0:00:01.860000 -- They're setting me up in a place downtown.\n",
      "146: 0:00:02.140000 -- Which means I'll be around to help with Molly.\n",
      "147: 0:00:03.180000 -- Which means you're going to be doing your spy work in our own back yard-Great.\n",
      "148: 0:00:02.100000 -- Someone's grouchy when they don't get their sleep.\n",
      "149: 0:00:01.240000 -- Molly's struggling.\n",
      "150: 0:00:01.290000 -- Nightmares, problems at school.\n",
      "151: 0:00:02.270000 -- I can't babysit her and you at the same time.\n",
      "152: 0:00:01.610000 -- And why would I need babysitting?\n",
      "153: 0:00:01.310000 -- You're in over your head.\n",
      "154: 0:00:02.670000 -- - Thank you, but- - they abducted me.\n",
      "155: 0:00:00.760000 -- Kept me prisoner.\n",
      "156: 0:00:01.350000 -- I know you think you can beat them at their own game,\n",
      "157: 0:00:02.700000 -- but, Mohinder, no offense, you're a professor.\n",
      "158: 0:00:00.910000 -- You're not 007.\n",
      "159: 0:00:02.590000 -- I told myself I would do whatever it took to take down the company.\n",
      "160: 0:00:01.290000 -- That's how I can help Molly.\n",
      "161: 0:00:01.780000 -- You want to help Molly?\n",
      "162: 0:00:01.130000 -- Don't die on her.\n",
      "163: 0:00:02.300000 -- Mohinder, you're home!\n",
      "164: 0:00:01.430000 -- That's right.\n",
      "165: 0:00:02.530000 -- And I'm never leaving again.\n",
      "166: 0:00:01.560000 -- What in heaven?\n",
      "167: 0:00:01.900000 -- All this blood and no wound.\n",
      "168: 0:00:01.820000 -- You have a power!\n",
      "169: 0:00:01.400000 -- An amazing power!\n",
      "170: 0:00:01.400000 -- What have you done to me?\n",
      "171: 0:00:02.720000 -- This is how you become a hero!\n",
      "172: 0:00:01.500000 -- This is impossible.\n",
      "173: 0:00:01.370000 -- This must be some sort of trick.\n",
      "174: 0:00:01.570000 -- No. Look.\n",
      "175: 0:00:01.940000 -- Lazarus risen.\n",
      "176: 0:00:01.320000 -- You've cursed me.\n",
      "177: 0:00:01.180000 -- No. This is not a curse.\n",
      "178: 0:00:01.370000 -- It's a gift.\n",
      "179: 0:00:02.360000 -- This gift will help you through the trials.\n",
      "180: 0:00:05.140000 -- To help find the fire scroll, uh, the 90 hungry ronins, help rescue Yaeko's father.\n",
      "181: 0:00:01.480000 -- Get away from me!\n",
      "182: 0:00:01.300000 -- You're a devil.\n",
      "183: 0:00:02.580000 -- No, no. I'm here to help you.\n",
      "184: 0:00:01.910000 -- Kensei, wait!\n",
      "185: 0:00:02.930000 -- We have to write history!\n",
      "186: 0:00:01.330000 -- Lightning.\n",
      "187: 0:00:00.660000 -- Lightning!\n",
      "188: 0:00:00.960000 -- Sparks!\n",
      "189: 0:00:01.180000 -- Lightning!\n",
      "190: 0:00:01.970000 -- So you just yell it out.\n",
      "191: 0:00:02.140000 -- Well, I'm just trying to understand how it works.\n",
      "192: 0:00:01.670000 -- That makes two of us.\n",
      "193: 0:00:02.200000 -- So far, I got nothin'.\n",
      "194: 0:00:03.290000 -- Well, it's a shame you can't order lightning up like a plate of chips.\n",
      "195: 0:00:02.370000 -- Sure would come in handy tonight.\n",
      "196: 0:00:02.200000 -- God, you know, I can do all these things.\n",
      "197: 0:00:03.440000 -- It's just-I feel powerless.\n",
      "198: 0:00:02.020000 -- It's tough not knowing who you are.\n",
      "199: 0:00:03.340000 -- Yeah, looks like I might just die before I ever figure it out.\n",
      "200: 0:00:04.070000 -- Maybe you're an extraterrestrial, escaped from a government facility.\n",
      "201: 0:00:04.260000 -- I have to admit, I'm pretty excited to see you open that box.\n",
      "202: 0:00:01.980000 -- And don't worry about tonight.\n",
      "203: 0:00:01.700000 -- I'll be there to watch your back.\n",
      "204: 0:00:01.890000 -- How do I know I can trust you?\n",
      "205: 0:00:03.280000 -- I haven't told anyone about what you can do, now have I?\n",
      "206: 0:00:01.640000 -- Why is that?\n",
      "207: 0:00:02.380000 -- Girl's gotta have her secrets.\n",
      "208: 0:00:02.680000 -- Dude, you look like ass.\n",
      "209: 0:00:01.900000 -- No English.\n",
      "210: 0:00:01.230000 -- All right.\n",
      "211: 0:00:03.070000 -- Today, we are talking about Mitosis.\n",
      "212: 0:00:01.010000 -- Yes, West.\n",
      "213: 0:00:01.800000 -- I have a question about yesterday's topic.\n",
      "214: 0:00:01.170000 -- \"Regeneration in lizards. \"\n",
      "215: 0:00:02.270000 -- Now, I know you said humans couldn't regenerate.\n",
      "216: 0:00:02.520000 -- But what if a lizard were to mate with a human?\n",
      "217: 0:00:01.170000 -- Could their offspring do it?\n",
      "218: 0:00:01.990000 -- Because I think I met a lizard girl.\n",
      "219: 0:00:03.040000 -- This doesn't strike me as a productive conversation, West.\n",
      "220: 0:00:00.620000 -- But seriously.\n",
      "221: 0:00:04.650000 -- What if that lizard girl were to accidentally cut off her arm,\n",
      "222: 0:00:02.840000 -- or a leg, or you name the appendage, in some kind of...\n",
      "223: 0:00:02.050000 -- horrifying spa-debacle?\n",
      "224: 0:00:01.940000 -- Where exactly are you going with this?\n",
      "225: 0:00:05.570000 -- Would said appendage reattach itself back onto her lizard body?\n",
      "226: 0:00:04.290000 -- I cut myself and the wound heals\n",
      "227: 0:00:02.050000 -- over and over again.\n",
      "228: 0:00:02.160000 -- You are a hero, like me.\n",
      "229: 0:00:01.200000 -- I have powers too.\n",
      "230: 0:00:01.570000 -- You?\n",
      "231: 0:00:01.780000 -- - Really? - Yes.\n",
      "232: 0:00:03.140000 -- I can stop time and move through space.\n",
      "233: 0:00:01.370000 -- Hello.\n",
      "234: 0:00:02.380000 -- How are such things possible?\n",
      "235: 0:00:02.670000 -- Some say it's a gift from God.\n",
      "236: 0:00:03.220000 -- Some people think it's evolution.\n",
      "237: 0:00:02.200000 -- What is that? Evolution?\n",
      "238: 0:00:03.470000 -- It means you can heal from any wound.\n",
      "239: 0:00:00.970000 -- Really?\n",
      "240: 0:00:01.550000 -- Any wound?\n",
      "241: 0:00:01.720000 -- Sword?\n",
      "242: 0:00:01.680000 -- Serpent?\n",
      "243: 0:00:01.370000 -- Fire?\n",
      "244: 0:00:02.650000 -- This'll make me richer than the Pope.\n",
      "245: 0:00:01.700000 -- - Rich? - Yes!\n",
      "246: 0:00:02.360000 -- Swordsman are obsessed with duels in this country.\n",
      "247: 0:00:01.130000 -- I'll clean up in wages.\n",
      "248: 0:00:04.310000 -- You have to defeat white beard and fight the 90 angry Ronin.\n",
      "249: 0:00:03.430000 -- If you're obsessed with my stories so much, how about you handle them?\n",
      "250: 0:00:02.560000 -- Kensei, you have to stopwalking away from your destiny!\n",
      "251: 0:00:01.900000 -- Who's going to stop me?\n",
      "252: 0:00:01.430000 -- Who?\n",
      "253: 0:00:03.900000 -- No one is going to stop me because no one can stop me.\n",
      "254: 0:00:02.060000 -- God. This is extraordinary!\n",
      "255: 0:00:01.490000 -- Where have you taken me?\n",
      "256: 0:00:01.710000 -- To get the fire scroll.\n",
      "257: 0:00:02.260000 -- It's on top of those steps.\n",
      "258: 0:00:01.700000 -- Who are they?\n",
      "259: 0:00:03.500000 -- Those are the 90 angry ronin, sworn to protect it.\n",
      "260: 0:00:01.560000 -- How angry are they?\n",
      "261: 0:00:01.340000 -- Good luck, Kensei.\n",
      "262: 0:00:01.660000 -- You can do this.\n",
      "263: 0:00:01.980000 -- I take it you're annoyed.\n",
      "264: 0:00:01.840000 -- What is it, West?\n",
      "265: 0:00:01.580000 -- What do you want from me?\n",
      "266: 0:00:02.790000 -- I want you to admit you're different.\n",
      "267: 0:00:01.230000 -- Okay, fine.\n",
      "268: 0:00:01.460000 -- I'm a freak. All right?\n",
      "269: 0:00:00.980000 -- Claire.\n",
      "270: 0:00:01.580000 -- I am such a freak, in fact,\n",
      "271: 0:00:03.430000 -- that I have to tiptoe around this school pretending to be some brainless barbie doll\n",
      "272: 0:00:02.520000 -- so nobody notices how different I am.\n",
      "273: 0:00:03.870000 -- 'Cause if they found out, I'd be carted off to some human zoo\n",
      "274: 0:00:02.980000 -- so I could be poked and prodded at for the rest of my life.\n",
      "275: 0:00:03.170000 -- So yeah, West, I'm different.\n",
      "276: 0:00:01.610000 -- And you can tell the world if you want to,\n",
      "277: 0:00:02.880000 -- because I am tired of pretending to be someone I'm not.\n",
      "278: 0:00:04.160000 -- Claire, shut up.\n",
      "279: 0:00:01.730000 -- Be careful.\n",
      "280: 0:00:01.560000 -- You too.\n",
      "281: 0:00:00.940000 -- Yes, who's there?\n",
      "282: 0:00:01.320000 -- Safeline. Here for the pickup.\n",
      "283: 0:00:01.200000 -- I want my money back.\n",
      "284: 0:00:01.650000 -- All right, back away, friend.\n",
      "285: 0:00:00.940000 -- I'm not your friend, okay?\n",
      "286: 0:00:01.390000 -- Just give me my $200 back.\n",
      "287: 0:00:02.560000 -- Look, Celtic was supposed to be a lock to win, okay?\n",
      "288: 0:00:01.100000 -- Just help a guy out.\n",
      "289: 0:00:01.450000 -- That's not our problem.\n",
      "290: 0:00:01.850000 -- Actually, it is your problem.\n",
      "291: 0:00:01.260000 -- Tie him up, Tuko.\n",
      "292: 0:00:08.180000 -- Mind these two.\n",
      "293: 0:00:01.440000 -- Stay down!\n",
      "294: 0:00:01.840000 -- That'll be that now.\n",
      "295: 0:00:01.470000 -- There he is!\n",
      "296: 0:00:01.570000 -- Stop!\n",
      "297: 0:00:01.530000 -- Go!\n",
      "298: 0:00:01.710000 -- Isn't this Isaac Mendez's loft?\n",
      "299: 0:00:01.100000 -- The painter.\n",
      "300: 0:00:01.430000 -- It was.\n",
      "301: 0:00:01.900000 -- Until Sylar killed him.\n",
      "302: 0:00:01.390000 -- He was murdered?\n",
      "303: 0:00:03.370000 -- Every space has some unhappiness in its past.\n",
      "304: 0:00:03.940000 -- The company recently poured a lot of money into outfitting this laboratory.\n",
      "305: 0:00:02.110000 -- Everything state of the art.\n",
      "306: 0:00:02.340000 -- Well, lucky timing for me then.\n",
      "307: 0:00:02.940000 -- Mohinder, it was built for you.\n",
      "308: 0:00:01.400000 -- I'm sorry.\n",
      "309: 0:00:03.410000 -- You don't realize how valued you are here at the company.\n",
      "310: 0:00:04.150000 -- Our people have been instructed to keep a close watch on you.\n",
      "311: 0:00:01.950000 -- To anticipate your every need.\n",
      "312: 0:00:01.780000 -- That is very generous of you.\n",
      "313: 0:00:02.140000 -- But really, I prefer to work on my own.\n",

      "399: 0:00:01.175000 -- No,\n",
      "400: 0:00:01.825000 -- it is I who am honored...\n",
      "401: 0:00:02.610000 -- to meet the great Takezo Kensei.\n",
      "402: 0:00:01.710000 -- Bye, friend.\n",
      "403: 0:00:01.090000 -- Kensei!\n",
      "404: 0:00:01.210000 -- Kensei!\n",
      "405: 0:00:02.300000 -- I made you some breakfast.\n",
      "406: 0:00:02.340000 -- I can't make it move.\n",
      "407: 0:00:04.530000 -- That cup. I used to be able to make things move with my mind.\n",
      "408: 0:00:02.575000 -- Thanks for making breakfast, Michelle, you're a real sport.\n",
      "409: 0:00:02.940000 -- I can't freeze anything. I can't move things. What happened to them?\n",
      "410: 0:00:02.617000 -- Uh, they must've disappeared with your injuries.\n",
      "411: 0:00:02.583000 -- I thought you said you were taking care of me?\n",
      "412: 0:00:02.490000 -- I'm sorry. Uh, are you breathing?\n",
      "413: 0:00:02.335000 -- No collapsed lung? No infection from the wound?\n",
      "414: 0:00:03.620000 -- Everything that I've been working for, everything that I had, it's gone.\n",
      "415: 0:00:03.585000 -- Listen, the people I work for, they're gonna make sure you get better.\n",
      "416: 0:00:03.180000 -- Your back's already healed. It's just your chest we're worried about.\n",
      "417: 0:00:01.870000 -- And when that heals,\n",
      "418: 0:00:02.300000 -- you'll be able to re-acquire your powers.\n",
      "419: 0:00:02.675000 -- With my help, of course.\n",
      "420: 0:00:01.315000 -- You.\n",
      "421: 0:00:01.745000 -- How are you gonna help?\n",
      "422: 0:00:02.460000 -- You gonna make me some more eggs?\n",
      "423: 0:00:02 -- By making it easy.\n",
      "424: 0:00:01.505000 -- By making it fun.\n",
      "425: 0:00:02.220000 -- I can take you anywhere you want to go.\n",
      "426: 0:00:01.835000 -- Paris. London.\n",
      "427: 0:00:01.800000 -- How about Japan?\n",
      "428: 0:00:01.765000 -- And I can be...\n",
      "429: 0:00:02.290000 -- anyone you want me to be.\n",
      "430: 0:00:03.990000 -- If your fantasy is exotic...\n",
      "431: 0:00:02.570000 -- or more run-of-the-mill.\n",
      "432: 0:00:05.780000 -- Or something more familiar, if that's what you're into.\n",
      "433: 0:00:02.595000 -- Don't you see? I can help you.\n",
      "434: 0:00:03.070000 -- We were meant to do this together.\n",
      "435: 0:00:02.300000 -- I under-estimated you.\n",
      "436: 0:00:02.830000 -- You really are extraordinary.\n",
      "437: 0:00:02.010000 -- Just like me.\n",
      "438: 0:00:01.435000 -- You were right.\n",
      "439: 0:00:02.660000 -- I am gonna get my abilities back.\n",
      "440: 0:00:02.730000 -- Starting with yours.\n",
      "441: 0:00:02.690000 -- So this is what you really look like.\n",
      "442: 0:00:03.700000 -- So silly trying to be something that you're not.\n",
      "443: 0:00:03.110000 -- Well, Michelle or Candice or whoever you are,\n",
      "444: 0:00:02.280000 -- it wasn't all for nothing.\n",
      "445: 0:00:02.260000 -- Thanks to you...\n",
      "446: 0:00:02.500000 -- I'll be going back to Maui now.\n",
      "447: 0:00:01.770000 -- London.\n",
      "448: 0:00:02.060000 -- Japan.\n",
      "449: 0:00:01.760000 -- Japan!\n",
      "450: 0:00:02.145000 -- It's not working.\n",
      "451: 0:00:02.110000 -- I don't have it.\n",
      "452: 0:00:02.330000 -- Your power. What's wrong with me?\n",
      "453: 0:00:01.580000 -- Ahh!\n",
      "454: 0:00:02.710000 -- Ah, would you quit being such a baby,\n",
      "455: 0:00:01.565000 -- Pretty boy?\n",
      "456: 0:00:01.520000 -- Peter.\n",
      "457: 0:00:02.180000 -- I may not know what you are,\n",
      "458: 0:00:02.250000 -- but I know who you are.\n",
      "459: 0:00:02.230000 -- You're one of us.\n",
      "460: 0:00:03.110000 -- And we have no secrets among family.\n",
      "461: 0:00:01.260000 -- Well?\n",
      "462: 0:00:01.890000 -- Well what?\n",
      "463: 0:00:01.690000 -- This is it.\n",
      "464: 0:00:01.765000 -- Your box. Your life.\n",
      "465: 0:00:02.340000 -- You gonna open it or what?\n",
      "466: 0:00:02.440000 -- What if it's a life I don't want?\n",
      "467: 0:00:02.160000 -- When I had Will against the wall,\n",
      "468: 0:00:01.655000 -- I could've killed him.\n",
      "469: 0:00:02.005000 -- I wanted to.\n",
      "470: 0:00:01.635000 -- What if that's who I am?\n",
      "471: 0:00:02.770000 -- - But you didn't kill him, did you? - No, that's because of you.\n",
      "472: 0:00:02.495000 -- It's not because of me, Peter.\n",
      "473: 0:00:02.100000 -- You're a good soul.\n",
      "474: 0:00:02.030000 -- I can tell.\n",
      "475: 0:00:03.410000 -- What if I open this box and I find otherwise?\n",
      "476: 0:00:02.600000 -- Do you like the way you are right now?\n",
      "477: 0:00:02.460000 -- Do you like who you are right now?\n",
      "478: 0:00:02.270000 -- Well, then maybe for now\n",
      "479: 0:00:02.005000 -- just leave it be.\n",
      "480: 0:00:01.875000 -- I think yours is cooler.\n",
      "481: 0:00:01.895000 -- Any time your parents get annoying,\n",
      "482: 0:00:02.470000 -- you can just open the window and take off.\n",
      "483: 0:00:01.400000 -- Are you kidding?\n",
      "484: 0:00:01.795000 -- You're indestructible.\n",
      "485: 0:00:02.225000 -- You can skydive without a parachute.\n",
      "486: 0:00:02.190000 -- You could skydive without a plane.\n",
      "487: 0:00:02.030000 -- you can eat fire just for kicks.\n",
      "488: 0:00:01.805000 -- I feel pain.\n",
      "489: 0:00:02.155000 -- I just get over it quickly.\n",
      "490: 0:00:02.440000 -- So how would it feel then if I-if I do this?\n",
      "491: 0:00:01.740000 -- Ow... It hurts!\n",
      "492: 0:00:01.880000 -- What about this then?\n",
      "493: 0:00:01.990000 -- What's on your neck?\n",
      "494: 0:00:02.930000 -- A couple years ago, when we were living in St. Louis\n",
      "495: 0:00:02.025000 -- I was riding my bike to school,\n",
      "496: 0:00:04.070000 -- and next thing I knew it was a day later and I was waking up in my bed.\n",
      "497: 0:00:02.165000 -- Last thing I remember is\n",
      "498: 0:00:02.880000 -- this man stepping out of the bushes calling my name.\n",
      "499: 0:00:02.065000 -- What are you talking about? What man?\n",
      "500: 0:00:01.555000 -- I don't know who he was.\n",
      "501: 0:00:02.410000 -- But I remember the way he looked at me.\n",
      "502: 0:00:02.450000 -- Like I was an animal he wanted to trap.\n",
      "503: 0:00:03.260000 -- I try to put him out of my head. But sometimes I can see his face.\n",
      "504: 0:00:02.660000 -- That guy with the horn-rimmed glasses.\n",
      "505: 0:00:02.010000 -- I have another vial.\n",
      "506: 0:00:02.290000 -- I'll get started on it right away.\n",
      "507: 0:00:01.480000 -- Yeah?\n",
      "508: 0:00:02.620000 -- I have to take this outside.\n",
      "509: 0:00:02.320000 -- - Where are you? - I just got here.\n",
      "510: 0:00:02.445000 -- I'm sitting in your office.\n",
      "511: 0:00:02.630000 -- Are you sure you're gonna be able to cure me?\n",
      "512: 0:00:01.350000 -- Yes.\n",
      "513: 0:00:01.965000 -- And like I said, in exchange,\n",
      "514: 0:00:03.160000 -- we're going to want a little something from you.\n",
      "515: 0:00:03.090000 -- They're moving the paintings somewhere. There's only a few crates left.\n",
      "516: 0:00:03.480000 -- This was a terrible idea. This guy's watching my every move.\n",
      "517: 0:00:02.335000 -- I can't do this. I'm in over my head.\n",
      "518: 0:00:02.265000 -- I told you you have no reason to worry.\n",
      "519: 0:00:02.961000 -- As long as I'm alive, you will be taken care of.\n",
      "520: 0:00:02.950000 -- - That's exactly the problem. - What are you talking about?\n",
      "521: 0:00:02.475000 -- I'm sending you a Jpeg of a painting I found.\n",

      "116: 0:00:01.800000 -- Do you know where he is now?\n",
      "117: 0:00:01.165000 -- Depends.\n",
      "118: 0:00:01.700000 -- Who's askin'?\n",
      "119: 0:00:01.700000 -- Just me.\n",
      "120: 0:00:03.900000 -- I work for a company interested in keeping him out of trouble.\n",
      "121: 0:00:02.850000 -- Peter is a.. dangerous guy.\n",
      "122: 0:00:02.815000 -- You don't have to tell me that.\n",
      "123: 0:00:01.365000 -- He's in town.\n",
      "124: 0:00:02.600000 -- Place called Wandering Rocks pub.\n",
      "125: 0:00:03.065000 -- Hey, if he's so dangerous, sweetheart,\n",
      "126: 0:00:03.300000 -- why'd they send a little girl like you in all alone?\n",
      "127: 0:00:02.600000 -- I can take care of myself.\n",
      "128: 0:00:01.700000 -- Bring her back to holding.\n",
      "129: 0:00:02.300000 -- What do you think you're doing interrogating my mother without me there?\n",
      "130: 0:00:00.630000 -- Relax.\n",
      "131: 0:00:00.965000 -- She didn't give me anything.\n",
      "132: 0:00:01.300000 -- Of course she didn't give you anything.\n",
      "133: 0:00:02.300000 -- These people protect each other.\n",
      "134: 0:00:01.165000 -- My mother's not a killer.\n",
      "135: 0:00:02.700000 -- I'm not gonna have her sit in jail for a crime she didn't commit.\n",
      "136: 0:00:00.830000 -- Neither am I.\n",
      "137: 0:00:02.400000 -- That's why I'm going to philadelphia to see my father,\n",
      "138: 0:00:01.500000 -- figure this whole thing out.\n",
      "139: 0:00:01.600000 -- - Let me come with you. - No!\n",
      "140: 0:00:00.865000 -- You're not a cop.\n",
      "141: 0:00:02.800000 -- Listen, I'm guessing this isn't official police business.\n",
      "142: 0:00:01.965000 -- So if I'm there, it won't really make a difference.\n",
      "143: 0:00:01.400000 -- Because officially, neither are you.\n",
      "144: 0:00:01.065000 -- You don't understand.\n",
      "145: 0:00:00.630000 -- It's molly.\n",
      "146: 0:00:00.900000 -- My father did something to her.\n",
      "147: 0:00:00.865000 -- She's in trouble.\n",
      "148: 0:00:01.600000 -- What do you mean \"did something to her\"?\n",
      "149: 0:00:01.365000 -- Come here.\n",
      "150: 0:00:01.100000 -- Did what?\n",
      "151: 0:00:01.765000 -- He got inside her head somehow.\n",
      "152: 0:00:01.700000 -- I don't know how he did it, but I think it's all connected.\n",
      "153: 0:00:00.600000 -- To Kaito.\n",
      "154: 0:00:01.200000 -- To your mother.\n",
      "155: 0:00:02 -- It could be dangerous.\n",
      "156: 0:00:02 -- I can take care of myself.\n",
      "157: 0:00:02.600000 -- Listen, I have to do this.\n",
      "158: 0:00:02.100000 -- Let me come with you.\n",
      "159: 0:00:01.200000 -- Fine.\n",
      "160: 0:00:01.600000 -- We can probably get there faster.\n",
      "161: 0:00:01.800000 -- You know, 'cause you can, uh...\n",
      "162: 0:00:01.400000 -- I'm not a cargo jet, Parkman.\n",
      "163: 0:00:01.500000 -- Oh, please.\n",
      "164: 0:00:01.800000 -- I need to talk to him.\n",
      "165: 0:00:01.600000 -- Alone.\n",
      "166: 0:00:01.900000 -- Tell him what you told me.\n",
      "167: 0:00:01.900000 -- This American girl...\n",
      "168: 0:00:02.150000 -- she's hitting all the boys on the dock,\n",
      "169: 0:00:02.115000 -- looking for a certain shipping container.\n",
      "170: 0:00:01.365000 -- She say what she wanted?\n",
      "171: 0:00:01.300000 -- Yeah.\n",
      "172: 0:00:01.500000 -- You.\n",
      "173: 0:00:01.600000 -- No worries, boyo.\n",
      "174: 0:00:01.400000 -- I think I can help.\n",
      "175: 0:00:01.065000 -- This is my problem.\n",
      "176: 0:00:03.600000 -- Not given what I just saw between you and my sister.\n",
      "177: 0:00:02 -- You care about her, don't you?\n",
      "178: 0:00:02.900000 -- Right now, she's the only thing in my life that means something.\n",
      "179: 0:00:02.465000 -- Caitlin has a flat up the hill.\n",
      "180: 0:00:02.300000 -- Go there and stay until I call you.\n",
      "181: 0:00:01.550000 -- I'll take care of your friend.\n",
      "182: 0:00:01.515000 -- I could handle this myself.\n",
      "183: 0:00:01.365000 -- I don't doubt it.\n",
      "184: 0:00:01.900000 -- I've seen what you can do.\n",
      "185: 0:00:02.600000 -- But I've got an investment in you now.\n",
      "186: 0:00:03.600000 -- Some little blonde's isn't going to scare me off.\n",
      "187: 0:00:01.200000 -- Now go on.\n",
      "188: 0:00:02.300000 -- And don't be telling caitlin about any of this.\n",
      "189: 0:00:02.065000 -- She'll only worry sick.\n",
      "190: 0:00:01.500000 -- Monica.\n",
      "191: 0:00:01.500000 -- Well?\n",
      "192: 0:00:01.365000 -- Well, what?\n",
      "193: 0:00:02.465000 -- Well, are you gonna tell me what that was all about?\n",
      "194: 0:00:02.800000 -- Uh, I just didn't want some crackhead looking for revenge.\n",
      "195: 0:00:01 -- So I said I didn't recognize him.\n",
      "196: 0:00:01.065000 -- No, not that.\n",
      "197: 0:00:04 -- I'm talking about the whole flying-karate-kick thing.\n",
      "198: 0:00:02.730000 -- Oh... that.\n",
      "199: 0:00:03.200000 -- Mr. Lamont said he has never seen anything like it.\n",
      "200: 0:00:02.500000 -- How did you do that?\n",
      "201: 0:00:04.200000 -- More importantly, why did you do that?\n",
      "202: 0:00:01.965000 -- I don't know.\n",
      "203: 0:00:02.900000 -- I don't know anything anymore.\n",
      "204: 0:00:02.200000 -- Nothing makes any sense.\n",
      "205: 0:00:01.300000 -- Well...\n",
      "206: 0:00:02.300000 -- where did you learn how to...\n",
      "207: 0:00:04.700000 -- I think... I think on tv.\n",
      "208: 0:00:03.265000 -- Something is happening to me, Camille.\n",
      "209: 0:00:04.900000 -- My body does things before my brain even knows what's happening.\n",
      "210: 0:00:02.965000 -- That thing with the tomatoes yesterday.\n",
      "211: 0:00:01.665000 -- Now this.\n",
      "212: 0:00:01.700000 -- It's like...\n",
      "213: 0:00:01.800000 -- Like what?\n",
      "214: 0:00:02.700000 -- I was supposed to be somebody, Camille.\n",
      "215: 0:00:04.700000 -- The first person in my family to go to college.\n",
      "216: 0:00:02.500000 -- Now look at me.\n",
      "217: 0:00:01.700000 -- You know what, never mind.\n",
      "218: 0:00:01.265000 -- I've been here since last night.\n",
      "219: 0:00:01.800000 -- I'm just gonna go home and sleep it off.\n",
      "220: 0:00:01.565000 -- Hey, Monica.\n",
      "221: 0:00:02.800000 -- Everything's gonna be okay.\n",
      "222: 0:00:02.300000 -- - Okay? - Yeah\n",
      "223: 0:00:02.100000 -- I hope so.\n",
      "224: 0:00:00.765000 -- All right, this is it.\n",
      "225: 0:00:01.400000 -- This is where Molly said we'd find him.\n",
      "226: 0:00:02.165000 -- What are you planning, exactly?\n",
      "227: 0:00:00.950000 -- I'm not sure.\n",
      "228: 0:00:00.915000 -- You're not sure?\n",
      "229: 0:00:01.600000 -- He traumatized your girl.\n",
      "230: 0:00:01.050000 -- Has my mother terrified.\n",
      "231: 0:00:01.015000 -- You better get sure.\n",
      "232: 0:00:01.500000 -- Get your gun out.\n",
      "233: 0:00:01.200000 -- Come on.\n",
      "234: 0:00:01.150000 -- Hey...\n",
      "235: 0:00:01.115000 -- You okay?\n",
      "236: 0:00:02.900000 -- When I was 13, my father ran out on us.\n",
      "237: 0:00:00.665000 -- I haven't talked to him.\n",
      "238: 0:00:02.365000 -- I haven't seen him.\n",
      "239: 0:00:00.965000 -- I've spent half my life thinking about\n",
      "240: 0:00:01.400000 -- what I'm gonna say to this guy if I ever got the chance.\n",
      "241: 0:00:02.900000 -- And now I can't even knock on the door.\n",
      "242: 0:00:01.665000 -- You're welcome.\n",
      "243: 0:00:01.800000 -- Parkman, this is not a family reunion.\n",
      "244: 0:00:00.630000 -- - I know. - Okay.\n",
      "245: 0:00:01 -- He's not your dad today.\n",
      "246: 0:00:01.432000 -- He is a suspect.\n",
      "247: 0:00:01.398000 -- Get your gun out.\n",
      "248: 0:00:02.200000 -- Police! Open up!\n",
      "249: 0:00:01.165000 -- Who the hell are you?!\n",
      "250: 0:00:01.565000 -- I said who the hell are you?!\n",
      "251: 0:00:01.500000 -- Put the gun down and I'll tell you.\n",
      "252: 0:00:01.500000 -- Parkman.\n",
      "253: 0:00:01.700000 -- Matt?\n",
      "254: 0:00:04.200000 -- Oh, my god. W- what are you doing here?\n",
      "255: 0:00:01.265000 -- Put the gun down.\n",
      "256: 0:00:02.100000 -- Not till you tell me what the hell you're doing here!\n",
      "257: 0:00:03.200000 -- - I want to know what you're doing inside Molly Walker's dreams. - Who?\n",
      "258: 0:00:02.665000 -- And what do you know about Kaito Nakamura's murder?\n",
      "259: 0:00:02.800000 -- And while we're at it, why is Angela Petrelli protecting you?\n",
      "260: 0:00:01.865000 -- Wait! What are you, a cop?\n",
      "261: 0:00:02.800000 -- Right now I'm not, so you better start talking.\n",
      "262: 0:00:01.100000 -- I'm good.\n",
      "263: 0:00:01.500000 -- You got it all wrong.\n",
      "264: 0:00:02.200000 -- That why you're swinging a shotgun?\n",
      "265: 0:00:01.300000 -- Because of that.\n",
      "266: 0:00:02.100000 -- On... on the desk.\n",
      "267: 0:00:02.200000 -- They're gonna kill me too.\n",
      "268: 0:00:01.265000 -- Tell me about Molly Walker.\n",
      "269: 0:00:01.500000 -- She's seen this symbol. She's seen you,\n",
      "270: 0:00:01.500000 -- and she calls you the nightmare man.\n",
      "271: 0:00:00.930000 -- She's looking for me.\n",
      "272: 0:00:02 -- Yeah, and she saw you looking back at her, and now she won't wake up.\n",
      "273: 0:00:01.365000 -- So whatever you did, undo it now.\n",
      "274: 0:00:01.950000 -- Sorry, I'm protecting myself.\n",
      "275: 0:00:02.107000 -- Protecting yourself from who?\n",
      "276: 0:00:02.073000 -- Which one of her kids are you?\n",
      "277: 0:00:02 -- You're the politician, right?\n",
      "278: 0:00:02.700000 -- My mother is sitting in jail for Kaito's murder.\n",
      "279: 0:00:02.065000 -- They both received similar threats.\n",
      "280: 0:00:02.300000 -- Both taken from the same picture.\n",
      "281: 0:00:01.432000 -- The same photograph.\n",
      "282: 0:00:01.398000 -- You were all connected.\n",
      "283: 0:00:01.750000 -- Your folks, Kaito...\n",
      "284: 0:00:01.680000 -- Linderman, me...\n",
      "285: 0:00:02.065000 -- we found each other years ago.\n",
      "286: 0:00:01.500000 -- We-we thought we could help people.\n",
      "287: 0:00:01.330000 -- Save the world.\n",
      "288: 0:00:03.900000 -- The only thing you've ever wanted to save is your own ass.\n",
      "289: 0:00:02.500000 -- Still angry, huh, Matt?\n",
      "290: 0:00:01 -- Feel better?\n",
      "291: 0:00:01.700000 -- Slapping the cuffs on your dad make you feel good?\n",
      "292: 0:00:02.065000 -- Oh, it's starting to, yeah.\n",
      "293: 0:00:01.665000 -- This is a waste of time.\n",
      "294: 0:00:02.100000 -- Just read his mind so we can get the hell out of here.\n",
      "295: 0:00:01.465000 -- What did you say?\n",
      "296: 0:00:01.400000 -- You can...\n",
      "297: 0:00:02.100000 -- read minds?\n",
      "298: 0:00:01.300000 -- Yeah?\n",
      "299: 0:00:01.800000 -- Go ahead.\n",
      "300: 0:00:01.400000 -- Go on.\n",
      "301: 0:00:01.300000 -- God!\n",
      "302: 0:00:01.800000 -- It's painful, isn't it?\n",
      "303: 0:00:01.400000 -- How do you know that?\n",
      "304: 0:00:01.365000 -- Can you read minds too?\n",
      "305: 0:00:03.700000 -- See, Matt, you and I, we're not so different after all.\n",
      "306: 0:00:03.100000 -- Come on, unlock these cuffs.\n",
      "307: 0:00:02.700000 -- I'll tell you everything I know.\n",
      "308: 0:00:01.700000 -- I promise.\n",
      "309: 0:00:02.500000 -- Isn't it wonderful?\n",
      "310: 0:00:03.600000 -- We've got a musician in the house again.\n",
      "311: 0:00:02.600000 -- Nobody's touched that thing since my mother died.\n",
      "312: 0:00:01.565000 -- Oh, I'm sorry.\n",
      "313: 0:00:01 -- Nana said I could, but if-\n",
      "314: 0:00:01.565000 -- Oh, yeah.\n",
      "315: 0:00:01.465000 -- It's okay.\n",
      "316: 0:00:02.100000 -- Please keep playing.\n",
      "317: 0:00:02.100000 -- You must really miss your mom.\n",
      "318: 0:00:02.100000 -- Yeah, I do.\n",
      "319: 0:00:01.800000 -- I miss mine too.\n",
      "320: 0:00:02.700000 -- Oh, I'm sure she's fine.\n",
      "321: 0:00:02.665000 -- And missing you right back.\n",
      "322: 0:00:02.400000 -- She wouldn't even tell me where she was going.\n",
      "323: 0:00:02.965000 -- You gotta remember she cares about you.\n",
      "324: 0:00:02.700000 -- I know new things can be scary.\n",
      "325: 0:00:05.700000 -- My mom always said god doesn't give us anything we can't handle.\n",
      "326: 0:00:01.500000 -- You play piano too?\n",
      "327: 0:00:01.300000 -- No.\n",
      "328: 0:00:01.800000 -- Never learned.\n",
      "329: 0:00:03.900000 -- If you don't play, then what was that?\n",
      "330: 0:00:01 -- Yes?\n",
      "331: 0:00:01.400000 -- I've been trying to reach you for hours.\n",
      "332: 0:00:01.332000 -- Where have you been?\n",
      "333: 0:00:01.298000 -- I'm at work. Why?\n",
      "334: 0:00:01 -- It's Molly.\n",
      "335: 0:00:02.200000 -- She won't wake up, and her vitals are getting worse.\n",
      "336: 0:00:01.600000 -- I'm running out of options here.\n",
      "337: 0:00:01.365000 -- Take her to the hospital.\n",
      "338: 0:00:01.165000 -- And say what?\n",
      "339: 0:00:01.500000 -- That she's trapped in a nightmare?\n",
      "340: 0:00:02.100000 -- No, I am taking her into the company.\n",
      "341: 0:00:01.665000 -- You can't be serious.\n",
      "342: 0:00:01.900000 -- These are the people we're fighting against.\n",
      "343: 0:00:01.430000 -- Molly won't last. Not like this.\n",
      "344: 0:00:02.500000 -- They are the only people who can understand what's happening to her.\n",
      "345: 0:00:01.600000 -- Don't do this.\n",
      "346: 0:00:04.800000 -- The moment you trust them with what you care about most, they'll have you.\n",
      "347: 0:00:02.800000 -- Don't forget whose side you're on.\n",
      "348: 0:00:01.700000 -- I'm on her side.\n",
      "349: 0:00:01.900000 -- All right, you gotta tell us everything.\n",
      "350: 0:00:00.700000 -- Every crime.\n",
      "351: 0:00:01.600000 -- Everyone you've ever worked with.\n",
      "352: 0:00:00.700000 -- Everything.\n",
      "353: 0:00:00.665000 -- I'm so sorry.\n",
      "354: 0:00:01.400000 -- I'm so sorry I left you.\n",
      "355: 0:00:01.365000 -- It wasn't easy for me.\n",
      "356: 0:00:00.565000 -- Don't.\n",
      "357: 0:00:01.500000 -- I need to say it.\n",
      "358: 0:00:03.100000 -- When I found out I could read minds, it was a temptation, I was weak.\n",
      "359: 0:00:02.700000 -- I used people. I was a real scumbag.\n",
      "360: 0:00:02.900000 -- You... a cop.\n",
      "361: 0:00:00.700000 -- I'm so proud.\n",
      "362: 0:00:00.750000 -- You don't get to be proud.\n",
      "363: 0:00:00.907000 -- You don't get to be anything.\n",
      "364: 0:00:00.838000 -- Just answer the questions.\n",
      "365: 0:00:03.300000 -- You said you tried to save the world.\n",
      "366: 0:00:01.030000 -- How?\n",
      "367: 0:00:01.465000 -- These gifts came out of nowhere.\n",
      "368: 0:00:03.700000 -- We just found each other, like we were connected somehow.\n",
      "369: 0:00:01.482000 -- We thought we were invincible.\n",
      "370: 0:00:01.448000 -- A few of us took that to heart.\n",
      "371: 0:00:01.500000 -- They started to do whatever they wanted.\n",
      "372: 0:00:01.865000 -- I did what I could to stop them.\n",
      "373: 0:00:01.465000 -- Like what?\n",
      "374: 0:00:02 -- This thing we can do, you and I.\n",
      "375: 0:00:02.900000 -- It only begins at reading minds.\n",
      "376: 0:00:02.865000 -- And then it becomes so much more.\n",
      "377: 0:00:01.100000 -- More how?\n",
      "378: 0:00:02.500000 -- I... I can't explain it.\n",
      "379: 0:00:01.800000 -- No, hang on.\n",
      "380: 0:00:01.800000 -- I got something I can show you.\n",
      "381: 0:00:01.730000 -- 'Cause it helped me understand it.\n",
      "382: 0:00:02.100000 -- Yeah, I got a bunch of stuff from back then.\n",
      "383: 0:00:01.500000 -- It's... it's in here.\n",
      "384: 0:00:01.765000 -- Oh, come on.\n",
      "385: 0:00:01.200000 -- Matt?\n",
      "386: 0:00:01.500000 -- Matt!\n",
      "387: 0:00:01.300000 -- Dad?\n",
      "388: 0:00:01.700000 -- Hey, what's going on?\n",
      "389: 0:00:02.100000 -- Hey, what the hell's going on?\n",
      "390: 0:00:01.300000 -- Where am I?\n",
      "391: 0:00:02.100000 -- This is impossible.\n",
      "392: 0:00:02.400000 -- We saved the city.\n",
      "393: 0:00:00.750000 -- Let me out!\n",
      "394: 0:00:00.680000 -- It's a mistake.\n",
      "395: 0:00:02.200000 -- I'm not supposed to be here.\n",
      "396: 0:00:03.700000 -- Yeah, no one's supposed to be here.\n",
      "397: 0:00:02.200000 -- Pleasant dreams.\n",
      "398: 0:00:01.300000 -- Monica.\n",
      "399: 0:00:02.900000 -- I think I know what happened with the piano.\n",
      "400: 0:00:00.565000 -- What can I say?\n",
      "401: 0:00:02.800000 -- Guess I'm just a musical genius.\n",
      "402: 0:00:03.165000 -- Or it's something else.\n",
      "403: 0:00:03.200000 -- Look, it's been a hard couple days for me.\n",
      "404: 0:00:03.130000 -- In fact, it's been a hard couple years.\n",
      "405: 0:00:05.300000 -- So I think I'm just gonna take a nice long nap, and sleep it off.\n",
      "406: 0:00:01.565000 -- Monica.\n",
      "407: 0:00:03.500000 -- Do you remember last night when I said I was able to rig the Pay-Per-View on the tv?\n",
      "408: 0:00:01.365000 -- Yeah.\n",
      "409: 0:00:01.900000 -- Well, I lied.\n",
      "410: 0:00:04.865000 -- How did- how did you-\n",
      "411: 0:00:02.700000 -- I think it runs in the family.\n",
      "412: 0:00:04.400000 -- I mean, maybe not exactly like me, but-\n",
      "413: 0:00:03 -- My dad could walk through walls.\n",
      "414: 0:00:01.400000 -- D.L.?\n",
      "415: 0:00:00.965000 -- Yeah.\n",
      "416: 0:00:01.600000 -- And my mom...\n",
      "417: 0:00:02.565000 -- don't even get me started on my mom.\n",
      "418: 0:00:04.100000 -- But I think what's going on with you is more like this.\n",
      "419: 0:00:01.800000 -- A comic book?\n",
      "420: 0:00:01.230000 -- Yeah.\n",
      "421: 0:00:01.400000 -- This is Saint Joan.\n",
      "422: 0:00:01.365000 -- She's a muscle mimic.\n",
      "423: 0:00:01.282000 -- A what?\n",
      "424: 0:00:01.248000 -- A copycat.\n",
      "425: 0:00:02.800000 -- Whatever she sees, she can do.\n",
      "426: 0:00:03.600000 -- That's just like what you did with me and the piano.\n",
      "427: 0:00:02.100000 -- A copycat.\n",
      "428: 0:00:01.700000 -- Copycat.\n",
      "429: 0:00:01.700000 -- Look at this.\n",
      "430: 0:00:02.300000 -- I shouldn't know how to do this.\n",
      "431: 0:00:02.800000 -- I saw it on tv.\n",
      "432: 0:00:02.400000 -- Oh, my god.\n",
      "433: 0:00:05.600000 -- So if this is really happening to you, maybe we ought to go test it out.\n",
      "434: 0:00:01.400000 -- I didn't know where else to go.\n",
      "435: 0:00:01.365000 -- Oh, you made the right choice.\n",
      "436: 0:00:03.600000 -- We're going to do everything we can for Molly.\n",
      "437: 0:00:03.900000 -- In the meantime, we have someone else who needs us.\n",
      "438: 0:00:01.765000 -- And we would like you to bring her in.\n",
      "439: 0:00:01.165000 -- You're sending me into the field?\n",
      "440: 0:00:00.665000 -- Yes.\n",
      "441: 0:00:00.965000 -- Molly needs me here.\n",
      "442: 0:00:02.900000 -- No, no, no. Molly is our top priority here,\n",
      "443: 0:00:04.500000 -- but we need you out there doing the good work you do, helping others like her.\n",
      "444: 0:00:03.600000 -- And, uh, you're gonna need this.\n",
      "445: 0:00:01.700000 -- This is how you help people?\n",
      "446: 0:00:01.630000 -- By tasering them?\n",
      "447: 0:00:03.850000 -- Well, that's just standard procedure to make sure everyone's safe.\n",
      "448: 0:00:03.815000 -- A lot of the people we encounter aren't in control of their abilities.\n",
      "449: 0:00:03.500000 -- But trust me, it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.\n",
      "450: 0:00:02.700000 -- Niki's loose, grab her!\n",
      "451: 0:00:00.565000 -- Down the hall.\n",
      "452: 0:00:01.665000 -- Grab her.\n",
      "453: 0:00:01.400000 -- Niki?\n",
      "454: 0:00:02.800000 -- What the hell is going on here?\n",
      "455: 0:00:02 -- So do you want to try something really rad?\n",
      "456: 0:00:01.665000 -- Like a kick flip?\n",
      "457: 0:00:01.800000 -- Slam dunk?\n",
      "458: 0:00:01.200000 -- Well...\n",
      "459: 0:00:03.100000 -- I always sucked at double dutch.\n",
      "460: 0:00:02.300000 -- You want somethin', lady?\n",
      "461: 0:00:02.800000 -- Yeah. I want to jump in.\n",
      "462: 0:00:01.800000 -- And don't call me lady.\n",
      "463: 0:00:01.500000 -- It's not much.\n",
      "464: 0:00:01.900000 -- I sleep in a pub, remember?\n",
      "465: 0:00:01.200000 -- You paint?\n",
      "466: 0:00:01.700000 -- Well, it's what I do to relax.\n",
      "467: 0:00:01.700000 -- These are amazing.\n",
      "468: 0:00:01 -- You're talented.\n",
      "469: 0:00:01.300000 -- Is that why you kidnapped me?\n",
      "470: 0:00:02.200000 -- So you could sort through me things?\n",
      "471: 0:00:03.300000 -- Don't start liking me less now that you're peeling away the mystery.\n",
      "472: 0:00:01.500000 -- I just...\n",
      "473: 0:00:02.200000 -- wanted to see where you lived.\n",
      "474: 0:00:02 -- Lie on a real bed maybe.\n",
      "475: 0:00:01.900000 -- No one's stopping you.\n",
      "476: 0:00:01.700000 -- What are you looking at?\n",
      "477: 0:00:01.900000 -- Nothing.\n",
      "478: 0:00:02.100000 -- Then what is it that's on your mind?\n",
      "479: 0:00:02.100000 -- You were right.\n",
      "480: 0:00:03.700000 -- Whatever I was, whoever I am...\n",
      "481: 0:00:02.500000 -- I have to face it.\n",
      "482: 0:00:03.300000 -- Nothing that I find in this box is gonna change anything.\n",
      "483: 0:00:04.100000 -- Whatever my life was before, this is where I want to be now.\n",
      "484: 0:00:01.600000 -- With you.\n",
      "485: 0:00:01.700000 -- Okay?\n",
      "486: 0:00:01.500000 -- Okay.\n",
      "487: 0:00:02 -- Get on with it then.\n",
      "488: 0:00:01.800000 -- Peter Petrelli?\n",
      "489: 0:00:02 -- I'm from New York.\n",
      "490: 0:00:01.100000 -- Looks like you were leaving.\n",
      "491: 0:00:02.600000 -- Th this is an open ticket, New York to Montreal.\n",
      "492: 0:00:01.500000 -- Who's that?\n",
      "493: 0:00:01.700000 -- I wish I knew.\n",
      "494: 0:00:02.100000 -- None of this tells me how I got here.\n",
      "495: 0:00:01.600000 -- What I'm supposed to do.\n",
      "496: 0:00:01.100000 -- What is it?\n",
      "497: 0:00:01.100000 -- Peter?\n",
      "498: 0:00:01.800000 -- Oh, my god, Peter!\n",
      "499: 0:00:03.100000 -- You know, I've never been in an Irish pub before.\n",
      "500: 0:00:01.900000 -- Do you have Haggis?\n",
      "501: 0:00:01.600000 -- That's Scotland, love.\n",
      "502: 0:00:01.600000 -- We have stew.\n",
      "503: 0:00:01.600000 -- And muscles.\n",
      "504: 0:00:01.200000 -- And stew.\n",
      "505: 0:00:01.200000 -- But I'm closing up.\n",
      "506: 0:00:02.200000 -- Oh, well...\n",
      "507: 0:00:02.200000 -- yeah, I was hoping you could help me.\n",
      "508: 0:00:02.100000 -- I'm looking for a guy.\n",
      "509: 0:00:02.400000 -- Best time for that's right after a football match.\n",
      "510: 0:00:02.200000 -- The fellas are locked out of their minds.\n",
      "511: 0:00:02 -- Up for anything.\n",
      "512: 0:00:02.200000 -- His name is Peter Petrelli.\n",
      "513: 0:00:01.800000 -- Never seen him before.\n",
      "514: 0:00:01.700000 -- Never seen him before?\n",
      "515: 0:00:01.200000 -- No.\n",
      "516: 0:00:01.800000 -- Cool. Thanks.\n",
      "517: 0:00:05 -- The thing is, I talked to a few people from the docks.\n",
      "518: 0:00:02.200000 -- They said they saw him in here.\n",
      "519: 0:00:02.500000 -- I don't know what to tell you.\n",
      "520: 0:00:04.200000 -- So either you're lying, or all those other people are lying.\n",
      "521: 0:00:03.100000 -- It's just kinda hard to tell who's lying, you know?\n",
      "522: 0:00:01 -- Like I said...\n",
      "523: 0:00:01.900000 -- I don't know this Peter.\n",
      "524: 0:00:01.800000 -- That it now?\n",
      "525: 0:00:01.800000 -- I guess so.\n",
      "526: 0:00:01.700000 -- Sorry I couldn't be more help.\n",
      "527: 0:00:01.200000 -- Yeah.\n",
      "528: 0:00:02.100000 -- So am I.\n",
      "529: 0:00:02.400000 -- You gave us quite a scare.\n",
      "530: 0:00:02.200000 -- I'm sorry about earlier.\n",
      "531: 0:00:01.800000 -- I'm feeling much better now.\n",
      "532: 0:00:01 -- Thank you.\n",
      "533: 0:00:02 -- We knew it wouldn't be easy.\n",
      "534: 0:00:03 -- Multiple-personality disorder is a terrible affliction,\n",
      "535: 0:00:02.500000 -- but we're gonna get you well again.\n",
      "536: 0:00:01.700000 -- I promise.\n",
      "537: 0:00:01.800000 -- Thank you.\n",
      "538: 0:00:00.700000 -- I'm gonna get you out of here.\n",
      "539: 0:00:00.900000 -- I can't leave.\n",
      "540: 0:00:01.600000 -- Niki, you're a prisoner.\n",
      "541: 0:00:01.700000 -- I'm not.\n",
      "542: 0:00:01.600000 -- I came here on my own.\n",
      "543: 0:00:02.100000 -- I gave up my son to be here.\n",
      "544: 0:00:01.600000 -- I'm sick.\n",
      "545: 0:00:03.400000 -- I didn't think anyone could ever understand my problems.\n",
      "546: 0:00:01.500000 -- What I've done.\n",
      "547: 0:00:02.300000 -- What I'm capable of.\n",
      "548: 0:00:02.100000 -- These are the only people that can help me.\n",
      "549: 0:00:01.100000 -- Nathan.\n",
      "550: 0:00:01 -- Peter?\n",

      "223: 0:00:01.866000 -- They cooked up here in the lab.\n",
      "224: 0:00:02.333000 -- It controls the abilities.\n",
      "225: 0:00:01.900000 -- Dampens them.\n",
      "226: 0:00:02.367000 -- Like that guy who was standing in the corner\n",
      "227: 0:00:01.066000 -- Of bob's office.\n",
      "228: 0:00:02.935000 -- The haitian. Yeah.\n",
      "229: 0:00:02.033000 -- Sorta.\n",
      "230: 0:00:00.966000 -- So let's just call them...\n",
      "231: 0:00:04.667000 -- Haitian pills.\n",
      "232: 0:00:00.966000 -- Bye, peter.\n",
      "233: 0:00:01 -- Ow!\n",
      "234: 0:00:01.634000 -- That hurts.\n",
      "235: 0:00:01.833000 -- You'll get used to it.\n",
      "236: 0:00:03.666000 -- And then you'll start to like it.\n",
      "237: 0:00:02.801000 -- Hello?\n",
      "238: 0:00:02.400000 -- Who said that?\n",
      "239: 0:00:01.701000 -- Me.\n",
      "240: 0:00:02.433000 -- (D.L.) * he's a jolly good fellow\n",
      "241: 0:00:03.701000 -- * it's micah's birthday today *\n",
      "242: 0:00:01.766000 -- All right!\n",
      "243: 0:00:02.667000 -- 11 years old.\n",
      "244: 0:00:02.633000 -- Almost the man of the house now.\n",
      "245: 0:00:01.167000 -- Mom?\n",
      "246: 0:00:01.400000 -- Did you make a wish, baby?\n",
      "247: 0:00:01.267000 -- (D.L.) Don't tell us.\n",
      "248: 0:00:01.367000 -- 'Cause you know it's not gonna come true.\n",
      "249: 0:00:01.399000 -- You both already know what i wished for, anyways.\n",
      "250: 0:00:01.133000 -- Micah, we've been over this.\n",
      "251: 0:00:01.599000 -- But i've got it all figured out.\n",
      "252: 0:00:02.701000 -- I could make the car radio pick up the police band.\n",
      "253: 0:00:01.733000 -- We could go to the crime scene and be heroes.\n",
      "254: 0:00:03 -- Or the police could just take care of it.\n",
      "255: 0:00:01.767000 -- We could be like the fantastic four.\n",
      "256: 0:00:04.034000 -- Minus one. But still.\n",
      "257: 0:00:02.334000 -- Micah, i wanna be a hero to you.\n",
      "258: 0:00:03.067000 -- And i finally figured out how to do that.\n",
      "259: 0:00:03.300000 -- I think i got a job.\n",
      "260: 0:00:01.066000 -- A good job.\n",
      "261: 0:00:01.200000 -- Doing what?\n",
      "262: 0:00:01.366000 -- Something that's gonna make you proud of me,\n",
      "263: 0:00:00.966000 -- I promise.\n",
      "264: 0:00:01.567000 -- Come on.\n",
      "265: 0:00:01.567000 -- I promised i'd take you bowling, right?\n",
      "266: 0:00:02.866000 -- Let's go.\n",
      "267: 0:00:01.067000 -- Mom, you coming?\n",
      "268: 0:00:03.367000 -- Your mom's had a long day, micah.\n",
      "269: 0:00:02.267000 -- Go get your jacket.\n",
      "270: 0:00:02.967000 -- All i want is to smile at my boy on his birthday,\n",
      "271: 0:00:01.200000 -- And i can't even do that.\n",
      "272: 0:00:01.567000 -- They said it's just gonna take a little while\n",
      "273: 0:00:02.199000 -- For the medication to level out.\n",
      "274: 0:00:04.300000 -- I just don't know how much longer i can do this.\n",
      "275: 0:00:03.367000 -- I wanna say things'll get better.\n",
      "276: 0:00:03.833000 -- But i know how that sounds.\n",
      "277: 0:00:02.966000 -- The truth is, they will.\n",
      "278: 0:00:02.534000 -- You know, it's been a month.\n",
      "279: 0:00:02.333000 -- You still haven't told me your name.\n",
      "280: 0:00:02.200000 -- Please, i just wanna be left alone.\n",
      "281: 0:00:02.800000 -- You came to the right place.\n",
      "282: 0:00:01.501000 -- I have to warn you, though,\n",
      "283: 0:00:02.433000 -- It does get a bit old.\n",
      "284: 0:00:03 -- Let me guess.\n",
      "285: 0:00:02.799000 -- You were living a perfectly ordinary life.\n",
      "286: 0:00:03.033000 -- Until one day you discovered you could do\n",
      "287: 0:00:01.833000 -- Incredible things.\n",
      "288: 0:00:03.334000 -- I bet it was wonderful at first.\n",
      "289: 0:00:02.401000 -- You thought perhaps you could save the world.\n",
      "290: 0:00:03.533000 -- And then you realized, tragically,\n",
      "291: 0:00:02.533000 -- That you were dangerous.\n",
      "292: 0:00:04.668000 -- I'll let you talk to me after a decade.\n",
      "293: 0:00:03.366000 -- Oh, actually, talk to me after three.\n",
      "294: 0:00:02.034000 -- If they wanna leave me in here forever,\n",
      "295: 0:00:01.534000 -- That's fine by me.\n",
      "296: 0:00:03.034000 -- You've been through something awful, haven't you?\n",
      "297: 0:00:02.967000 -- I'm sorry.\n",
      "298: 0:00:01.866000 -- I'm peter.\n",
      "299: 0:00:01.600000 -- Hello, peter.\n",
      "300: 0:00:02.201000 -- It's nice to meet you.\n",
      "301: 0:00:02.234000 -- I'm adam.\n",
      "302: 0:00:02.800000 -- ...\n",
      "303: 0:00:02.733000 -- I'm not in the mood today, elle.\n",
      "304: 0:00:02.399000 -- Just a little one?\n",
      "305: 0:00:02.500000 -- I'll up your dose.\n",
      "306: 0:00:02.100000 -- I'm fine.\n",
      "307: 0:00:03.134000 -- Just a little one.\n",
      "308: 0:00:01.200000 -- Oh!\n",
      "309: 0:00:04.368000 -- Not that a fistful of pills everyday isn't fun, but...\n",
      "310: 0:00:01.533000 -- It's been two months now and i still don't know\n",
      "311: 0:00:01.100000 -- A thing about you.\n",
      "312: 0:00:01.432000 -- I was just thinking...\n",
      "313: 0:00:01.267000 -- Maybe there's more to you than the whole\n",
      "314: 0:00:01.700000 -- Sadistic lightning thing, that's all.\n",
      "315: 0:00:02.234000 -- What's your story?\n",
      "316: 0:00:03.767000 -- I liked you better when you just laid there.\n",
      "317: 0:00:02.466000 -- So you're not gonna tell me?\n",
      "318: 0:00:02.801000 -- What are you, afraid?\n",
      "319: 0:00:01.165000 -- No.\n",
      "320: 0:00:02.867000 -- You just like to be in control.\n",
      "321: 0:00:03.132000 -- I get it.\n",
      "322: 0:00:01.900000 -- I figured as much.\n",
      "323: 0:00:03.233000 -- Sorry i asked. Won't happen again.\n",
      "324: 0:00:02.233000 -- I accidentally set my grandmother's house\n",
      "325: 0:00:01.833000 -- On fire when i was six.\n",
      "326: 0:00:01.134000 -- Caused a blackout\n",
      "327: 0:00:03.167000 -- In four counties in ohio when i was eight.\n",
      "328: 0:00:02.934000 -- I spent my ninth birthday in a glass room\n",
      "329: 0:00:01.700000 -- With an iv of lithium in my arm.\n",
      "330: 0:00:04 -- I've lived in this building for 16 years.\n",
      "331: 0:00:03.100000 -- Ever since the shrinks diagnosed me\n",
      "332: 0:00:02.633000 -- As a sociopath with paranoid delusions.\n",
      "333: 0:00:02.267000 -- But they were just out to get me\n",
      "334: 0:00:01.800000 -- Because i threatened to kill 'em.\n",
      "335: 0:00:04.432000 -- I'm 24 years old, and i've never gone on a date.\n",
      "336: 0:00:01.734000 -- Never been on a roller coaster.\n",
      "337: 0:00:02.233000 -- Never been swimming.\n",
      "338: 0:00:02.434000 -- And now you know everything there is to know about me.\n",
      "339: 0:00:02.334000 -- I don't have the luxury of being more interesting\n",
      "340: 0:00:02.800000 -- Than that.\n",
      "341: 0:00:02.733000 -- Later, alligator.\n",
      "342: 0:00:03.367000 -- (Adam) word to the wise, friend.\n",
      "343: 0:00:02.567000 -- I would keep my distance from that one.\n",
      "344: 0:00:02.534000 -- I caved in a desperate moment six years ago,\n",
      "345: 0:00:02.433000 -- And i'm still paying the price.\n",
      "346: 0:00:01.101000 -- Don't worry.\n",
      "347: 0:00:01.233000 -- I don't want anything from her\n",
      "348: 0:00:01 -- Except the drugs.\n",
      "349: 0:00:02.867000 -- I'm sorry, i keep forgetting.\n",
      "350: 0:00:02.134000 -- You still believe them.\n",
      "351: 0:00:02.933000 -- What do you mean?\n",
      "352: 0:00:01.833000 -- This cure of theirs.\n",
      "353: 0:00:02.266000 -- They've been days away from perfecting it\n",
      "354: 0:00:03.634000 -- Since i got here 30 years ago.\n",
      "355: 0:00:02.066000 -- Bob's not trying to fix you, peter.\n",
      "356: 0:00:02.199000 -- No.\n",
      "357: 0:00:02.768000 -- They created this facility to help us.\n",
      "358: 0:00:02.533000 -- You're not in a facility, peter.\n",
      "359: 0:00:02.167000 -- Look around.\n",
      "360: 0:00:02.566000 -- You're in a prison.\n",
      "361: 0:00:02.134000 -- You don't believe me?\n",
      "362: 0:00:01.501000 -- Why don't you try getting out?\n",
      "363: 0:00:02.500000 -- ...\n",
      "364: 0:00:02.067000 -- Oh, i'm sorry.\n",

      "366: 0:00:02.466000 -- He said it was all a lie.\n",
      "367: 0:00:02.468000 -- What happened to him, and...\n",
      "368: 0:00:03.367000 -- To peter, and the car crash.\n",
      "369: 0:00:03.233000 -- I take it he told you he thought he could fly.\n",
      "370: 0:00:03.467000 -- And the plot to blow up new york.\n",
      "371: 0:00:02.100000 -- That peter was a bomb.\n",
      "372: 0:00:02.900000 -- It must be the pain medication.\n",
      "373: 0:00:02.200000 -- You deserve to know this.\n",
      "374: 0:00:03.733000 -- I tried to keep it from you and the boys.\n",
      "375: 0:00:01.467000 -- What?\n",
      "376: 0:00:04.667000 -- There's a dark secret in the petrelli family.\n",
      "377: 0:00:02.834000 -- It started with their father.\n",
      "378: 0:00:01.666000 -- Delusions of grandeur,\n",
      "379: 0:00:02.666000 -- Paranoia.\n",
      "380: 0:00:01.334000 -- It lead to his suicide.\n",
      "381: 0:00:02.501000 -- But sadly...\n",
      "382: 0:00:03.500000 -- That disease has obviously been passed down.\n",
      "383: 0:00:02.800000 -- My god.\n",
      "384: 0:00:03.134000 -- Now...\n",
      "385: 0:00:02.401000 -- Nathan's a great man.\n",
      "386: 0:00:03.499000 -- And his life is gonna be very complicated.\n",
      "387: 0:00:04.067000 -- He really deserves his dignity and his...\n",
      "388: 0:00:02.933000 -- His privacy.\n",
      "389: 0:00:02.599000 -- So i hope you understand\n",
      "390: 0:00:05.601000 -- That this has to be kept secret.\n",
      "391: 0:00:02.833000 -- Can i count on you for that, heidi?\n",
      "392: 0:00:01.967000 -- Hi, what can i do to get you inside a--\n",

      "396: 0:00:01.400000 -- Hi, what can i do...\n",
      "397: 0:00:01.400000 -- Depends on what you're gonna do to me\n",
      "398: 0:00:02.701000 -- Once you get me inside.\n",
      "399: 0:00:02 -- I got a great feeling about your first day.\n",
      "400: 0:00:04.833000 -- My butterflies have butterflies.\n",
      "401: 0:00:01.900000 -- Nik, i am so proud of you.\n",
      "402: 0:00:02.600000 -- I knew that medication would work out.\n",
      "403: 0:00:01.933000 -- You were right.\n",
      "404: 0:00:01.400000 -- I'm gonna take micah to school.\n",

      "408: 0:00:04.500000 -- We're gonna celebrate.\n",
      "409: 0:00:04.367000 -- (Gina) he's gonna know you're not taking the stupid pills.\n",
      "410: 0:00:03.400000 -- Go away, jessica.\n",
      "411: 0:00:01.367000 -- I don't need you anymore.\n",
      "412: 0:00:02.499000 -- What makes you think this is jessica?\n",
      "413: 0:00:01.267000 -- Remember me?\n",
      "414: 0:00:02.766000 -- That summer that you ran away to l.A.\n",
      "415: 0:00:03.200000 -- And told everyone to call you gina?\n",
      "416: 0:00:02.034000 -- You're not real.\n",
      "417: 0:00:01.834000 -- Oh, you're gonna sell cars?\n",
      "418: 0:00:03.033000 -- I'm going back to l.A. To go play.\n",
      "419: 0:00:02.833000 -- No, i'm in control.\n",
      "420: 0:00:04 -- If i can handle jessica, i can handle you.\n",
      "421: 0:00:04.366000 -- Then why aren't you taking your meds?\n",
      "422: 0:00:01.933000 -- [Niki banging on glass] no!\n",

      "426: 0:00:01.900000 -- Just for a day or two.\n",
      "427: 0:00:05.167000 -- Yes, i-I think that would be absolutely possible.\n",
      "428: 0:00:01.400000 -- Just not right now.\n",
      "429: 0:00:01.633000 -- Why not?\n",
      "430: 0:00:03.300000 -- They don't even know i'm alive.\n",
      "431: 0:00:02.833000 -- Look, i could let you go, and you could explode again.\n",
      "432: 0:00:01.866000 -- You could blow up half the east coast.\n",
      "433: 0:00:01.533000 -- Okay, so dose me with some drugs\n",
      "434: 0:00:01.800000 -- And i'll be back before they wear off.\n",
      "435: 0:00:01.100000 -- It's perfectly safe.\n",
      "436: 0:00:01.766000 -- I'm sorry, peter.\n",
      "437: 0:00:01.434000 -- You're just not ready for that yet.\n",

      "228: 0:00:01 -- It was an accident.\n",
      "229: 0:00:01.600000 -- You really think he's forgiven you?\n",
      "230: 0:00:01.400000 -- She was cheating on him.\n",
      "231: 0:00:01.200000 -- So she deserved to die?\n",
      "232: 0:00:02.600000 -- That's not what I meant. it's just--\n",
      "233: 0:00:02.100000 -- Buyou wanted to kill her, didn't you, Maya?\n",
      "234: 0:00:02.200000 -- Stop it. let me go.\n",

      "238: 0:00:01.500000 -- Please!o this.\n",
      "239: 0:00:01.800000 -- If you can control your power,\n",
      "240: 0:00:02.300000 -- No more innocent people have to die.\n",
      "241: 0:00:02.600000 -- Ahh! I can't!\n",
      "242: 0:00:02.400000 -- Help. you're killing me.\n",
      "243: 0:00:02.500000 -- Help...please.\n",
      "245: 0:00:01.300000 -- You were right.\n",
      "246: 0:00:01.300000 -- I did it.\n",
      "262: 0:00:01.500000 -- I don't think we should go in there guns blazing.\n",
      "263: 0:00:01.500000 -- Let's just tell Victoria the truth.\n",
      "264: 0:00:01.700000 -- Ask her straight out where to find the virus.\n",
      "265: 0:00:02 -- This woman can't be trusted, Peter.\n",
      "266: 0:00:02.200000 -- She worked for the company. she locked me up.\n",
      "267: 0:00:01.300000 -- One glance at me on her garden path\n",
      "268: 0:00:01.600000 -- Is liable to affect her mood.\n",
      "269: 0:00:02.100000 -- Fine. I'll go alone.\n",
      "270: 0:00:00.800000 -- No.\n",
      "271: 0:00:01.300000 -- You lost?\n",
      "272: 0:00:01.200000 -- Hope not.\n",
      "273: 0:00:01.700000 -- I'm looking for victoria Pratt.\n",
      "274: 0:00:01.100000 -- Never heard of her.\n",
      "275: 0:00:01.700000 -- You worked for the company.\n",
      "276: 0:00:02.900000 -- In 24 hours, the Shanti virus is released.\n",
      "277: 0:00:01.200000 -- A year from now,\n",
      "278: 0:00:02.700000 -- 93% of the world's population is dead.\n",
      "279: 0:00:02.800000 -- How can anyone know what happens a year from now?\n",
      "280: 0:00:01 -- I've been there.\n",
      "281: 0:00:00.800000 -- I've seen it.\n",
      "282: 0:00:01.200000 -- A time traveler.\n",
      "283: 0:00:03 -- You created a virus that kills billons of people.\n",
      "284: 0:00:03 -- I don't know how it gets out or where,\n",
      "285: 0:00:00.900000 -- Only that it does.\n",
      "286: 0:00:01.600000 -- Unless you help me.\n",
      "287: 0:00:02.800000 -- Inside...now.\n",
      "306: 0:00:02.200000 -- Containment breach in bio-research.\n",
      "307: 0:00:02.600000 -- Evacuation protocol in full effect.\n",
      "308: 0:00:02.500000 -- You have betrayed everything we stand for.\n",
      "309: 0:00:02 -- No, Kaito, I tried to save the world.\n",
      "310: 0:00:01.600000 -- By releasing a virus\n",
      "311: 0:00:01.800000 -- That could kill billons of innocent people?\n",
      "312: 0:00:01.800000 -- When you're been around as long as I have,\n",
      "313: 0:00:01.200000 -- The patterns become clear.\n",
      "314: 0:00:02.700000 -- Constant war. disregard for the environment.\n",
      "315: 0:00:02.200000 -- Famine. and it's only getting worse.\n",
      "316: 0:00:01.500000 -- Someone had to make the hard choice\n",
      "317: 0:00:01.200000 -- For the greater good.\n",
      "318: 0:00:01.600000 -- Take him down to lockup.\n",
      "319: 0:00:01.800000 -- And throw away the key!\n",
      "320: 0:00:01.600000 -- Are you all right, Victoria?\n",
      "321: 0:00:02.100000 -- He was looking for Strain 138.\n",
      "322: 0:00:01 -- If he'd been successful,\n",
      "323: 0:00:01.600000 -- This place would've been ground zero\n",
      "324: 0:00:01.500000 -- For a global pandemic.\n",
      "325: 0:00:01.100000 -- Thank you for saving us.\n",
      "326: 0:00:02 -- You need to shut down the program, Kaito.\n",
      "327: 0:00:01 -- Give it to me.\n",
      "328: 0:00:00.800000 -- This will be taken\n",
      "329: 0:00:02.300000 -- To the primatech facility in odessa.\n",
      "330: 0:00:03.600000 -- With Adam locked away, it will be safe.\n",
      "331: 0:00:00.800000 -- Look, with something that dangerous,\n",
      "332: 0:00:01.300000 -- There is no safe.\n",
      "333: 0:00:02.400000 -- That virus needs to be destroyed.\n",
      "334: 0:00:02.800000 -- The other founders would never allow that.\n",
      "335: 0:00:01.700000 -- Doesn't that concern you?\n",
      "336: 0:00:01.800000 -- Adam had help, Kaito.\n",
      "337: 0:00:02.100000 -- It's the only way he would have known what to look for.\n",
      "338: 0:00:01.800000 -- I suggest you take a few days off\n",
      "339: 0:00:02.100000 -- Before resuming your work.\n",
      "340: 0:00:03.900000 -- I won't be a part of this. not anymore.\n",
      "341: 0:00:02.100000 -- After Kaito and the others were killed,\n",
      "342: 0:00:01.200000 -- I figured that sooner or later\n",
      "343: 0:00:01.900000 -- Someone would come after me.\n",
      "344: 0:00:01.500000 -- You look like your mother.\n",
      "345: 0:00:01.400000 -- I don't know anything about this.\n",
      "346: 0:00:02.100000 -- The last time I saw my mother was a year from now,\n",
      "347: 0:00:02.300000 -- In a future where the world had already been devastated\n",
      "348: 0:00:01.300000 -- By the shanti virus.\n",
      "349: 0:00:02.400000 -- Forgive my paranoia, but I don't know you.\n",
      "350: 0:00:03 -- I only knew your parents and what they were capable of.\n",
      "351: 0:00:01.200000 -- There was a woman.\n",
      "352: 0:00:00.900000 -- Caitlin.\n",
      "353: 0:00:02.300000 -- She trusted me to protect her.\n",
      "354: 0:00:00.900000 -- Now...\n",
      "355: 0:00:02.400000 -- Somehow I took us into the future,\n",
      "356: 0:00:01.600000 -- And now I can't get back.\n",
      "357: 0:00:03.300000 -- So if you just tell me where to find the virus,\n",
      "358: 0:00:01.400000 -- I know that I can save her.\n",
      "359: 0:00:02.300000 -- You're looking for a mutated strain.\n",
      "360: 0:00:01.500000 -- 138.\n",
      "361: 0:00:02.600000 -- If it were ever released,\n",
      "362: 0:00:01.300000 -- It would kill us all.\n",
      "363: 0:00:01.600000 -- She tell you where to find the virus?\n",
      "364: 0:00:02.200000 -- Company storage facility in new mexico.\n",
      "365: 0:00:00.900000 -- New mexico?\n",
      "366: 0:00:01.700000 -- Company never had a facility--\n",
      "367: 0:00:01.300000 -- Wait, you don't understand.\n",
      "368: 0:00:01 -- No, you're working with him now.\n",
      "369: 0:00:02 -- That's all I need to know.\n",
      "370: 0:00:02.800000 -- I knew blowing your head off was the only way to be sure.\n",
      "371: 0:00:01.600000 -- Better late than never.\n",
      "372: 0:00:01.100000 -- Thanks, Peter.\n",
      "373: 0:00:01.600000 -- Let's get her up to the house.\n",
      "374: 0:00:01.100000 -- Alejandro!\n",
      "389: 0:00:01 -- Maya?\n",
      "390: 0:00:01.900000 -- Did you tell your brother the good news?\n",
      "392: 0:00:01.300000 -- Is something wrong?\n",
      "393: 0:00:01 -- This...\n",
      "394: 0:00:02.200000 -- Says you murdered your mother.\n",
      "395: 0:00:02.100000 -- But I know you didn't. you couldn't.\n",
      "396: 0:00:01.200000 -- It's te.\n",
      "397: 0:00:01.200000 -- I did it.\n",
      "398: 0:00:01.100000 -- I killed her.\n",
      "400: 0:00:01.800000 -- When my mother found out what I could do,\n",
      "401: 0:00:01.500000 -- She didn't understand.\n",
      "402: 0:00:02 -- Shtold me I was a monster.\n",
      "403: 0:00:02.400000 -- My own mother tried to kill me, Maya.\n",
      "404: 0:00:02.400000 -- And as I defended myself,\n",
      "405: 0:00:01.800000 -- There was an accident.\n",
      "406: 0:00:01.400000 -- I understand.\n",
      "423: 0:00:02.100000 -- Everything's gonna be okay, Maya.\n",
      "424: 0:00:01.700000 -- I'll take care of you.\n",
      "425: 0:00:01.500000 -- Why did you lie to me, Victoria?\n",
      "426: 0:00:01.400000 -- You're with him.\n",
      "427: 0:00:01.900000 -- You're helping Adam release the virus.\n",
      "428: 0:00:01.200000 -- Release the virus?\n",
      "429: 0:00:02.500000 -- I'm trying to find the virus so I can destroy it.\n",

      "186: 0:00:01.420000 -- Yes.\n",
      "187: 0:00:03.720000 -- No more running. No more hiding. No more secrets.\n",
      "188: 0:00:01.910000 -- Your father couldn't take down this company,Claire.\n",
      "189: 0:00:02.500000 -- What makes you think you can?\n",
      "190: 0:00:02.980000 -- I don't know if you can understand it.\n",
      "191: 0:00:03.220000 -- They only target people with abilities.\n",
      "192: 0:00:02.200000 -- People like me.\n",
      "193: 0:00:02.520000 -- You are still my daughter,Claire.\n",
      "194: 0:00:03.310000 -- I dream about you going to college,getting married someday.\n",
      "195: 0:00:02.340000 -- What if they take you from me...\n",
      "196: 0:00:03.460000 -- Use you in some lab experiment?\n",
      "197: 0:00:02.140000 -- I love you,mom.\n",
      "198: 0:00:03.260000 -- But I can't live in fear of some big \"What if?\"\n",
      "199: 0:00:03.610000 -- Do you realize how much damage you've done by provoking Claire?\n",
      "200: 0:00:01.670000 -- I couldn't help it.\n",
      "201: 0:00:05.060000 -- She was just so... weepy and earnest and...\n",
      "202: 0:00:01.710000 -- Who knew she'd turn whistle-blower?\n",
      "203: 0:00:02.860000 -- It's totally unprofessional, not to mention petty.\n",
      "204: 0:00:02.610000 -- And Claire is not even in your league!\n",
      "205: 0:00:02.470000 -- She isn't working with a gunshot wound.\n",
      "206: 0:00:04.940000 -- You and I both know you have performed well below what you can do.\n",
      "207: 0:00:01.920000 -- You're benched.\n",

      "214: 0:00:01.700000 -- I'm stuck in this hell-hole.\n",
      "215: 0:00:01.500000 -- My family thinks I'm dead.\n",
      "216: 0:00:02.850000 -- There's not a lot of incentive to share.\n",
      "217: 0:00:02.380000 -- I could make you tell me.\n",
      "218: 0:00:01.840000 -- You could try.\n",
      "219: 0:00:01.550000 -- Please.\n",

      "222: 0:00:05.570000 -- Enough to power a flashlight, street lamp,an entire city block?\n",
      "223: 0:00:03.370000 -- During testing,you'd pass out from the strain.\n",
      "224: 0:00:01.540000 -- We'd all want to call it a day,but daddy said,\n",
      "225: 0:00:02.900000 -- \"No,my girl's tougher than that.\"\n",
      "226: 0:00:02.270000 -- You were seven.\n",
      "227: 0:00:03.450000 -- You know,the hardest thing a parent ever does\n",
      "228: 0:00:03.464000 -- is to have to see their child in pain.\n",
      "229: 0:00:01.880000 -- Most parents.\n",
      "230: 0:00:01.370000 -- Elle.\n",
      "231: 0:00:02.390000 -- What are you doing here?\n",
      "232: 0:00:01.630000 -- Leaving.\n",
      "233: 0:00:02.590000 -- Noah,we have a problem.\n",
      "234: 0:00:01.990000 -- I'm not part of your \"We. \"\n",
      "235: 0:00:01.760000 -- Do you remember?\n",
      "236: 0:00:02.340000 -- This is about Claire.\n",
      "237: 0:00:02.880000 -- She's becoming difficult.\n",
      "238: 0:00:01.970000 -- Is she?\n",
      "239: 0:00:03.220000 -- I need to know if she could possibly have any hard evidence\n",
      "240: 0:00:03.100000 -- Which could leave this company exposed.\n",
      "241: 0:00:01.020000 -- That's unfortunate.\n",
      "242: 0:00:03.580000 -- Because now we're going to have to take measures to keep your daughter quiet.\n",
      "243: 0:00:02.443000 -- - Mom! - Micah! Where have you been?\n",
      "244: 0:00:01.550000 -- I've been looking everywhere for you.\n",
      "245: 0:00:02.400000 -- Monica tried to get my stuff back that was stolen.\n",
      "246: 0:00:01.510000 -- Dad's medal,my comics.\n",
      "247: 0:00:01.970000 -- I told you to let the police handle it.\n",
      "248: 0:00:01.390000 -- She got caught.\n",
      "249: 0:00:01.050000 -- I'm calling the police.\n",
      "250: 0:00:02.050000 -- You can call them after we find her.\n",
      "251: 0:00:01.380000 -- She was taken in a red van.\n",
      "252: 0:00:01.330000 -- We have to rescue her.\n",
      "253: 0:00:01.950000 -- - With your super strength- - Micah,stop.\n",
      "254: 0:00:02.170000 -- I don't have my strength anymore.\n",
      "255: 0:00:00.900000 -- What?\n",
      "256: 0:00:02.710000 -- The virus- It has side effects.\n",
      "257: 0:00:02.490000 -- But it's okay. I got a call from Dr. Suresh.\n",
      "258: 0:00:01.530000 -- He maybe found a cure.\n",
      "259: 0:00:02.170000 -- He's on his way here to make me better.\n",
      "260: 0:00:01.540000 -- I hope so.\n",
      "261: 0:00:02.040000 -- But right now, Monica needs my help.\n",
      "262: 0:00:02.370000 -- So all you have to do is drive.\n",
      "263: 0:00:02.500000 -- Warning. Security breach.\n",
      "264: 0:00:02.480000 -- Unauthorized personnel in the area.\n",
      "265: 0:00:01.900000 -- I believe it's up to the left.\n",
      "266: 0:00:02.230000 -- Oh,please. It's been 30 years.\n",
      "267: 0:00:02.260000 -- Warning security breach.\n",
      "268: 0:00:02.310000 -- - Unauthorized personnel in the area. - Take care of that,will you?\n",
      "269: 0:00:01.500000 -- So what do we do now?\n",
      "270: 0:00:03.120000 -- I guess you'll have to pry it open with that brain of yours.\n",
      "271: 0:00:02.100000 -- I'm not sure I have that sort of power.\n",
      "272: 0:00:04.920000 -- There's not much at stake here- Just the fate of the entire human race.\n",
      "273: 0:00:01.940000 -- Did you kill Hiro's father?\n",
      "274: 0:00:01.240000 -- I did.\n",
      "275: 0:00:02.260000 -- He saw to it that the virus be safely kept here.\n",
      "276: 0:00:02.850000 -- If he didn't plan to use it,why not destroy it?\n",
      "277: 0:00:01.980000 -- Why don't you make me believe you,Adam.\n",
      "278: 0:00:01.140000 -- Hiro said not to trust you.\n",
      "279: 0:00:02.500000 -- The woman you love is trapped in some\n",
      "280: 0:00:02.509000 -- horrible future where nearly everyone's dead.\n",
      "281: 0:00:02.180000 -- You can change that.\n",
      "282: 0:00:02.040000 -- She needs you,Peter.\n",
      "283: 0:00:03.140000 -- We all need you... to open that door.\n",
      "284: 0:00:02.140000 -- Hey you're nothing like you said you were.\n",
      "285: 0:00:01.980000 -- Alejandro was right about you all along.\n",
      "286: 0:00:02.790000 -- You wanna get rid of your powers,I want mine back.\n",
      "287: 0:00:04.130000 -- After Suresh fixes me,I'll gladly take yours off your hands.\n",
      "288: 0:00:01.700000 -- There's a bed over there.\n",
      "289: 0:00:01.050000 -- Stay put.\n",
      "290: 0:00:01.460000 -- Stay calm.\n",
      "291: 0:00:01.670000 -- And remember...\n",
      "292: 0:00:01.250000 -- Mohinder.\n",
      "293: 0:00:02.270000 -- It'll be okay, Molly,I promise.\n",
      "294: 0:00:03.420000 -- So this is your... laboratory,huh?\n",
      "295: 0:00:04.050000 -- I killed that artist,Isaac Mendez, right on this very spot.\n",
      "296: 0:00:01.860000 -- I'm going to have to take a sample of your blood.\n",
      "297: 0:00:01.140000 -- Why?\n",
      "298: 0:00:01.570000 -- You self-diagnosed.\n",
      "299: 0:00:02.340000 -- I need to know what strain of the virus you have.\n",
      "300: 0:00:01.170000 -- Or if you even have it at all.\n",
      "301: 0:00:01.190000 -- Just give me the remedy.\n",
      "302: 0:00:01.500000 -- Doesn't work like that.\n",
      "303: 0:00:01.740000 -- The wrong dosage will kill you.\n",
      "304: 0:00:01.690000 -- Your father helped me find my gift.\n",
      "305: 0:00:01.380000 -- Now here you are restoring it.\n",
      "306: 0:00:01.960000 -- Life has its poetry,doesn't it?\n",
      "307: 0:00:01.210000 -- My father who you murdered.\n",
      "308: 0:00:02.080000 -- Your father who betrayed me.\n",
      "309: 0:00:02.180000 -- Don't make that same mistake,Mohinder.\n",
      "310: 0:00:04.270000 -- Does Suresh know you have him on video surveillance?\n",
      "311: 0:00:01.220000 -- Sylar.\n",
      "312: 0:00:02.410000 -- Oh,daddy,you're gonna be so proud of me.\n",
      "313: 0:00:00.980000 -- Where am I?\n",
      "314: 0:00:01.280000 -- That doesn't matter.\n",
      "315: 0:00:02.450000 -- Both you and it are about to get country fried.\n",
      "316: 0:00:01.190000 -- Please,let me go!\n",
      "317: 0:00:02.540000 -- I swear,I was only trying to help somebody!\n",
      "318: 0:00:03.140000 -- You should've thought about that before you started messing up my business.\n",
      "319: 0:00:02.390000 -- So you thought you was gonna be a hero,huh?\n",
      "320: 0:00:02.540000 -- You know what happens to heroes in the real world?\n",
      "321: 0:00:01.560000 -- They end up dead...\n",
      "322: 0:00:01.580000 -- Just like you.\n",
      "323: 0:00:01.350000 -- Turn left here.\n",
      "324: 0:00:01.880000 -- Explain to me how that works.\n",
      "325: 0:00:03.440000 -- Monica has a cell phone,and the battery emits a tiny GPS signal\n",
      "326: 0:00:02.610000 -- Which I can use to try and get her position.\n",
      "327: 0:00:03.740000 -- Basically,I told your cell phone to find her cell phone and show me where it is.\n",
      "328: 0:00:01.430000 -- You told the phone.\n",
      "329: 0:00:01.280000 -- Yeah.\n",
      "330: 0:00:02.180000 -- Don't slow down. The light will change.\n",
      "331: 0:00:01.030000 -- Let me guess.\n",
      "332: 0:00:01.540000 -- You told it to?\n",
      "333: 0:00:01.960000 -- Slow down,slow down,slow down!\n",
      "334: 0:00:01.030000 -- Okay...\n",
      "335: 0:00:02.210000 -- We don't talk about that ever again.\n",
      "336: 0:00:01.150000 -- Agreed.\n",
      "337: 0:00:03.160000 -- Look,before we go in,I need to know something.\n",
      "338: 0:00:02.400000 -- Is Peter as dangerous as he was in Kirby Plaza?\n",
      "339: 0:00:01.370000 -- You know,with the whole-Puhh!\n",
      "340: 0:00:02.690000 -- I haven't seen him since that night,but I trust him with my life,Parkman.\n",
      "341: 0:00:02.100000 -- Yeah,but your mother...\n",
      "342: 0:00:04.310000 -- Your mother told me that if I had to, that I should kill Peter.\n",
      "343: 0:00:02.400000 -- Listening to my mother has never led to anything good.\n",
      "344: 0:00:02.510000 -- If Peter becomes a problem,I'll handle him.\n",
      "345: 0:00:01.690000 -- Flying man!\n",
      "346: 0:00:02.180000 -- Who's this guy supposed to be?\n",
      "347: 0:00:01.210000 -- Oh,good,you're here.\n",
      "348: 0:00:01.220000 -- Uh,so these two boxes are done.\n",
      "349: 0:00:01.430000 -- They can go in the car.\n",
      "350: 0:00:02.960000 -- I didn't come to help you,Claire.\n",
      "351: 0:00:02.070000 -- I came to stop you.\n",
      "352: 0:00:02.500000 -- These people ruined my life.\n",
      "353: 0:00:01.730000 -- - Your life. - No.\n",
      "354: 0:00:01.230000 -- They didn't.\n",
      "355: 0:00:02.920000 -- But what you're about to do- I'm pretty sure that will.\n",
      "356: 0:00:02.760000 -- West,you're the one who said that we were special,\n",
      "357: 0:00:02.160000 -- That the rules didn't apply to us.\n",
      "358: 0:00:01.730000 -- I think you misunderstood me.\n",
      "359: 0:00:03.060000 -- If we show everyone what we can do,they'll listen to us.\n",
      "360: 0:00:01.420000 -- I can't.\n",
      "361: 0:00:02.080000 -- I like my secrets.\n",
      "362: 0:00:04.630000 -- And I liked finding in you, someone who I could share that with.\n",
      "363: 0:00:02.530000 -- But after you go public,it's all gone.\n",
      "364: 0:00:02.800000 -- You saw what they did to my dad.\n",
      "365: 0:00:02.640000 -- This is the only way to beat them.\n",
      "366: 0:00:03.620000 -- Exposing us, isn't going to bring him back.\n",
      "367: 0:00:01.410000 -- Fine.\n",
      "368: 0:00:01.030000 -- Here's your file.\n",
      "369: 0:00:01.940000 -- It's everything they have on you.\n",
      "370: 0:00:02.230000 -- Now there isn't an \"Us\" for you to be worried about.\n",
      "371: 0:00:01.760000 -- Claire,please,don't do this.\n",
      "372: 0:00:02.680000 -- You won't leave me, will you,Mr. Muggles?\n",
      "373: 0:00:01.840000 -- Hello, Claire-Bear.\n",
      "374: 0:00:02.320000 -- I wish Alejandro was here to help.\n",
      "375: 0:00:01.080000 -- Who's that?\n",
      "376: 0:00:01.710000 -- He's my brother.\n",
      "377: 0:00:01.760000 -- I sent him away.\n",
      "378: 0:00:03.160000 -- Gabriel said-\n",
      "379: 0:00:02.030000 -- I can find him for you.\n",
      "380: 0:00:01.680000 -- Even if he is far away.\n",
      "381: 0:00:01.660000 -- So you know he's safe.\n",
      "382: 0:00:01.340000 -- You can?\n",
      "383: 0:00:01.230000 -- How?\n",
      "384: 0:00:02.050000 -- I just know where people are.\n",
      "385: 0:00:03.060000 -- I need a picture or something to think about.\n",
      "386: 0:00:01.680000 -- This is Alejandro.\n",
      "387: 0:00:00.930000 -- Here.\n",
      "388: 0:00:02.020000 -- He's not anywhere.\n",
      "389: 0:00:01.610000 -- But...\n",
      "390: 0:00:02.170000 -- If he's not anywhere...\n",
      "391: 0:00:04.200000 -- -How? -You have the same strain of the virus Niki has.\n",
      "392: 0:00:02.430000 -- The company injected you as well.\n",
      "393: 0:00:01.700000 -- Injected me?\n",

      "2: 0:00:02.340000 --  The sun rises on a new dawn.\n",
      "3: 0:00:04.237000 --  Yet few of us realize the debt we owe to those responsible for this.\n",
      "4: 0:00:12.997000 --  To those who dwell among us, anonymous, seemingly ordinary, whom destiny brought together to repair, to heal, to save us from ourselves.\n",
      "5: 0:00:04.865000 --  If evolution can do this for even the smallest of creatures, then why not these human beings?\n",
      "6: 0:00:03.800000 --  If someone here... found out about me, what would happen?\n",
      "7: 0:00:02.392000 --  - When will they stop? - I don't know.\n",
      "8: 0:00:03.526000 --  She's a shiny new toy, and she's all mine.\n",
      "9: 0:00:04.934000 --  And they're still out there, among us, in the shadows, in the light.\n",
      "10: 0:00:05.319000 --  We pass them on the street without a glance, never suspecting, never knowing.\n",
      "11: 0:00:01.763000 --  Do they even know yet?\n",
      "12: 0:00:07.356000 --  That they are bound together by a common purpose, a glaring reality, to be extraordinary?\n",
      "13: 0:00:03.994000 --  Teleportation, tissue generation, these are no longer simply theories.\n",
      "14: 0:00:02.381000 --  I have seen them with my own eyes.\n",
      "15: 0:00:02.077000 --  And when destiny does anoint them...\n",
      "16: 0:00:02.449000 --  My name is Hiro Nakamura. I'm from the future.\n",
      "17: 0:00:01.749000 --  How do they hide from it?\n",
      "18: 0:00:04.634000 --  You may feel confined here, but this is far freer a cage than the one they'd put you in.\n",
      "19: 0:00:08.804000 --  How long can they dwell in the shadows before either fate or their own flawed humanity draws them out into the light again?\n",
      "20: 0:00:03.608000 --  And how will they know what awaits them when it finally does?\n",

      "22: 0:00:04.699000 --  And not only are these special individuals among us, they bear a curse.\n",
      "23: 0:00:05.524000 --  A virus which strips them of their powers and leads to their eventual death.\n",
      "24: 0:00:03.321000 --  In the last few months, I've discovered what I believe to be a plague.\n",
      "25: 0:00:03.403000 --  A plague which targets only these unique individuals.\n",
      "26: 0:00:06.876000 --  It's a disease which threatens to eradicate them all. And in doing so, deprives our species of its evolutionary advancement.\n",
      "27: 0:00:10.576000 --  Without this advancement, the challenges of the modern world: global warming, terrorism, diminishing resources, seem almost insurmountable on our thin shoulders.\n",
      "28: 0:00:03.039000 --  The fate of humanity itself hangs in the balance.\n",
      "29: 0:00:04.428000 --  But with proper funding and research, we can stop the advancement of this disease.\n",
      "30: 0:00:06.315000 --  I urge each and every one of you to take up this cause, spread the word, and fight those who would keep the world from the truth.\n",

      "34: 0:00:02.036000 --  Your father would've been so proud.\n",
      "35: 0:00:01.424000 --  So would your sister.\n",
      "36: 0:00:02.132000 --  Who the hell are you and why are you following me?\n",
      "37: 0:00:01.517000 --  This isn't necessary. I'm nobody.\n",
      "38: 0:00:02.583000 --  What, you think I didn't recognize you? You've been at three of my lectures.\n",
      "39: 0:00:02.637000 --  The company sent you to bag and tag me? Is that it?\n",
      "40: 0:00:05.346000 --  A year ago, I would've run, but not anymore! Well, that's good, because if you had, I wouldn't be able to offer you a job.\n",
      "41: 0:00:03.635000 --  I've been down that road before. It doesn't end well.\n",
      "42: 0:00:02.077000 --  Where will you go, Dr. Suresh?\n",
      "43: 0:00:02.474000 --  No one even believes they exist.\n",
      "44: 0:00:06.255000 --  I found your father's book in the parapsychology section in-between hypnosis and alien abductions.\n",
      "45: 0:00:01.859000 --  They don't take you seriously.\n",
      "46: 0:00:01.968000 --  They all think you're nuts.\n",
      "47: 0:00:01.298000 --  But not me.\n",
      "48: 0:00:06.629000 --  So if you're really interested in saving the world, The least you can do is let me buy you a drink.\n",
      "49: 0:00:01.220000 --  Are they really gone?\n",
      "50: 0:00:01.143000 --  For now.\n",
      "51: 0:00:01.291000 --  We've got to keep going.\n",
      "52: 0:00:02.147000 --  We've been running for eight hundred miles.\n",
      "53: 0:00:02.505000 --  - I can't run anymore. - We have no choice.\n",
      "54: 0:00:01.451000 --  What if we don't make it?\n",
      "55: 0:00:02.445000 --  If we get caught, people could die.\n",
      "56: 0:00:02.003000 --  They'll die if we don't run.\n",
      "57: 0:00:02.425000 --  By tuesday we'll be in America.\n",
      "58: 0:00:02.200000 --  There, we can find the answers we need.\n",
      "59: 0:00:02.515000 --  Besides, I promised Mom that I wouldn't let you slow down.\n",
      "60: 0:00:02.663000 --  All the electives I wanted filled up last semester.\n",
      "61: 0:00:02.942000 --  Come on. It's your first day. You should be excited. I am.\n",
      "62: 0:00:01.487000 --  Well, it's easy for you to say.\n",
      "63: 0:00:03.147000 --  You're not wading into the shark-infested waters of 11th grade.\n",
      "64: 0:00:01.832000 --  I don't have one friend. I am shark bait.\n",
      "65: 0:00:01.857000 --  You're gonna do fine.\n",
      "66: 0:00:02.460000 --  They don't look any different from the kids in Texas.\n",
      "67: 0:00:03.403000 --  Okay, except for her. So maybe they're a little bit more...\n",
      "68: 0:00:02.501000 --  sophisticated here, but you're gonna fit right in.\n",
      "69: 0:00:01.176000 --  If you say so.\n",
      "70: 0:00:01.828000 --  Just remember what we talked about.\n",
      "71: 0:00:02.925000 --  I know. I'm Claire Butler. I won't slip up.\n",
      "72: 0:00:02.036000 --  It's not just the name. It's everything.\n",
      "73: 0:00:02.463000 --  Trust me. The company is still out there.\n",
      "74: 0:00:02.569000 --  And they will find us unless we're flawless with our plan.\n",
      "75: 0:00:01.421000 --  From now on...\n",
      "76: 0:00:02.815000 --  you have to be entirely un-extraordinary.\n",
      "77: 0:00:02.228000 --  Right. Don't stand out in any way.\n",
      "78: 0:00:02.132000 --  Exactly. Don't raise your hand in class.\n",
      "79: 0:00:02.542000 --  And don't even think about trying out for cheerleading.\n",
      "80: 0:00:01.941000 --  Come on, dad. That's all behind me.\n",
      "81: 0:00:03.895000 --  - Just blend in. Be ordinary, right? - You got it.\n",
      "82: 0:00:03.117000 --  You know, we might want to start by you not driving me to school.\n",
      "83: 0:00:01.968000 --  It kind of draws attention to me.\n",
      "84: 0:00:01.217000 --  And, you know...\n",
      "85: 0:00:03.143000 --  don't you think it might be easier on all of us if...\n",
      "86: 0:00:01.462000 --  I had my own car?\n",
      "87: 0:00:03.526000 --  Your mother and I were going to surprise you on your birthday next month.\n",
      "88: 0:00:01.202000 --  but...\n",
      "89: 0:00:01.736000 --  My gosh. The rogue?\n",
      "90: 0:00:01.998000 --  - Thank you, daddy! - It's yours.\n",
      "91: 0:00:01.930000 --  - You're the best dad in the world. - I know.\n",
      "92: 0:00:01.298000 --  I know.\n",
      "93: 0:00:01.230000 --  It's just...\n",
      "94: 0:00:02.624000 --  I just can't help thinking about how many times I've said...\n",
      "95: 0:00:01.941000 --  good-bye to you on the first day of school.\n",
      "96: 0:00:02.105000 --  I'm so sorry for everything I've put you through.\n",
      "97: 0:00:01.982000 --  Hope you know how much I love you.\n",
      "98: 0:00:01.449000 --  Sorry.\n",
      "99: 0:00:25.131000 --  Not again! Ready! The past isn't a very safe place.\n",
      "100: 0:00:01.779000 --  Not so safe for you either.\n",
      "101: 0:00:20.872000 --  Oh my God! You are Takezo Kensei! My hero! I must save you! I'm asking one more time.\n",
      "102: 0:00:02.364000 --  Come out with your hands up.\n",
      "103: 0:00:03.855000 --  Look, I know this sucks, NYPD showing up at your door like this.\n",
      "104: 0:00:03.568000 --  I get it. But this is what happens when you take somebody hostage.\n",
      "105: 0:00:02.898000 --  I just need to make sure everybody gets out of there safely, okay?\n",
      "106: 0:00:01.435000 --  Both of you, hands up.\n",
      "107: 0:00:09.399000 --  No, I'm the hostage! Shoot her. No, I'm the hostage! I'm the hostage! Shoot her! I'm the hostage! No, shoot him! Shoot him. Shoot her.\n",
      "108: 0:00:04.768000 --  Shoot her! Shoot her! Dude, it's her. Shoot her.\n",
      "109: 0:00:08.764000 --  Shoot her. Shoot her! How did you know?\n",
      "110: 0:00:01.312000 --  Okay, guys. good job.\n",
      "111: 0:00:01.408000 --  Let's clean this place up.\n",
      "112: 0:00:01.490000 --  All guns to the armory.\n",
      "113: 0:00:02.105000 --  How did you know which one to shoot?\n",
      "114: 0:00:02.228000 --  I don't know. Tone of voice. Eye contact.\n",
      "115: 0:00:02.952000 --  The hostage looked me in the eye. The other was looking for an exit.\n",
      "116: 0:00:02.802000 --  Well, most people notice a gun under the bad guy's shirt.\n",
      "117: 0:00:01.940000 --  Right. Yeah, that too. Of course.\n",
      "118: 0:00:07.397000 --  You know, guys who get shot like you did, they just take that worker's comp and call it a day.\n",
      "119: 0:00:03.283000 --  I've been, uh, I've wanted to be a cop my whole life.\n",
      "120: 0:00:02.652000 --  Four bullets to the chest aren't gonna change that.\n",
      "121: 0:00:02.836000 --  Well, we were gonna drag this out, make you sweat.\n",
      "122: 0:00:01.913000 --  But i figured, what's the point?\n",
      "123: 0:00:01.148000 --  Take that off.\n",
      "124: 0:00:04.138000 --  I figured that, you'd rather have a real one.\n",
      "125: 0:00:01.667000 --  - Well, you gonna take it? - Yeah.\n",
      "126: 0:00:03.376000 --  Turn on your bunsen burners, people, and be careful.\n",
      "127: 0:00:01.805000 --  You got a death wish?\n",
      "128: 0:00:01.818000 --  You talking about that?\n",
      "129: 0:00:02.747000 --  I was just seeing how hot it was.\n",
      "130: 0:00:02.938000 --  Pretty sure it's hot. It's called a \"flame. \"\n",
      "131: 0:00:01.886000 --  Yeah. I was just kidding around.\n",
      "132: 0:00:04.647000 --  Like you were this morning, when you stepped in front of my car?\n",
      "133: 0:00:02.816000 --  That's okay. Made my morning interesting.\n",
      "134: 0:00:02.488000 --  - I'm West. - Claire.\n",
      "135: 0:00:01.187000 --  You're new, right?\n",
      "136: 0:00:01.217000 --  So what are you?\n",
      "137: 0:00:01.340000 --  Meaning what, exactly?\n",
      "138: 0:00:01.927000 --  Meaning are you one of them...\n",
      "139: 0:00:01.408000 --  or one of the others?\n",
      "140: 0:00:02.638000 --  I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.\n",
      "141: 0:00:05.032000 --  Well, let me break it down for you. Are you a robot or an alien?\n",
      "142: 0:00:02.023000 --  Cause everyone in the world is one or the other.\n",
      "143: 0:00:02.723000 --  Robots do what they're told. stick with the herd.\n",
      "144: 0:00:02.870000 --  Aliens, on the other hand, do their own thing.\n",
      "145: 0:00:03.147000 --  Well, I don't know. Do I have to choose?\n",
      "146: 0:00:01.394000 --  Most people do.\n",
      "147: 0:00:01.518000 --  So what are you?\n",
      "148: 0:00:01.328000 --  Okay, everyone.\n",
      "149: 0:00:07.121000 --  In the struggle for survival, it is the fittest who win out at the expense of their rivals.\n",
      "150: 0:00:02.652000 --  Now who said this?\n",
      "151: 0:00:01.489000 --  Come on, people.\n",
      "152: 0:00:01.460000 --  Journey of the beagle.\n",
      "153: 0:00:01.208000 --  Evolution.\n",
      "154: 0:00:01.230000 --  Anyone?\n",
      "155: 0:00:01.428000 --  Charles Darwin.\n",
      "156: 0:00:01.476000 --  It's Charles Darwin.\n",
      "157: 0:00:01.216000 --  Easy one.\n",
      "158: 0:00:01.890000 --  Looks like my lucky day.\n",
      "159: 0:00:01.143000 --  How much?\n",
      "160: 0:00:01.251000 --  Ten thousand Lempiras...\n",
      "161: 0:00:01.884000 --  I'll take you as far as Sonora.\n",
      "162: 0:00:03.907000 --  That's six hundred miles from the American border.\n",
      "163: 0:00:01.143000 --  Okay.\n",
      "164: 0:00:01.065000 --  You two married?\n",
      "165: 0:00:01.189000 --  She's my sister.\n",
      "166: 0:00:01.112000 --  Even better.\n",
      "167: 0:00:02.167000 --  You can ride with me up front.\n",
      "168: 0:00:01.097000 --  In your dreams.\n",
      "169: 0:00:02.517000 --  Ride with me or you don't ride at all.\n",
      "170: 0:00:01.298000 --  She stays with me.\n",
      "171: 0:00:01.514000 --  We'll ride in back.\n",
      "172: 0:00:01.175000 --  You are late.\n",
      "173: 0:00:02.022000 --  Oo, I believe I'm right on time.\n",
      "174: 0:00:02.117000 --  I believe that your watch is slow.\n",
      "175: 0:00:01.341000 --  - Guess what? - What?\n",
      "176: 0:00:01.961000 --  Max Grossman tried to kiss me today.\n",
      "177: 0:00:01.599000 --  - What? - Mr. Parkman?\n",
      "178: 0:00:02.350000 --  - Yeah. - Can I speak you for a minute?\n",
      "179: 0:00:02.381000 --  - Sure. Can you give us a second? - Sure.\n",
      "180: 0:00:01.093000 --  Is everything okay?\n",
      "181: 0:00:02.420000 --  Yeah, I'm just a little concerned, that's all.\n",
      "182: 0:00:02.610000 --  Molly's been falling asleep in class the last week or so.\n",
      "183: 0:00:03.663000 --  and when I asked her about it, she said she's been having some nightmares.\n",
      "184: 0:00:01.699000 --  She's got kind of a big imagination.\n",
      "185: 0:00:05.207000 --  and I realize that there's really nothing I can do about them, so I'm just trying to make her feel as safe as possible.\n",
      "186: 0:00:04.020000 --  About that, I know it's not exactly my place, but...\n",
      "187: 0:00:02.291000 --  your situation isn't the most stable.\n",
      "188: 0:00:02.941000 --  - My situation? - Your injuries. Your divorce.\n",
      "189: 0:00:03.219000 --  Look, uh, my divorce is my business.\n",
      "190: 0:00:04.814000 --  And all you really need to know is that molly is loved and well-cared for and she's doing great.\n",
      "191: 0:00:02.091000 --  - She's struggling, Mr. Parkman. - What?\n",
      "192: 0:00:01.927000 --  Why, because she's having a few nightmares?\n",
      "193: 0:00:01.312000 --  Because of these.\n",
      "194: 0:00:02.378000 --  She started drawing them a week or so ago.\n",
      "195: 0:00:02.036000 --  Every day, they get a little worse.\n",
      "196: 0:00:01.243000 --  Oh, my God.\n",
      "197: 0:00:03.389000 --  And I have to ask you, what is this?\n",
      "198: 0:00:01.804000 --  It's in every single picture.\n",
      "199: 0:00:01.148000 --  Excuse me.\n",
      "200: 0:00:01.900000 --  Sir, with no disrespect to you or Hiro...\n",
      "201: 0:00:03.382000 --  it's been almost four months... and there's been no sign of him.\n",
      "202: 0:00:02.054000 --  Maybe he's not coming back.\n",
      "203: 0:00:01.498000 --  For close to thirty years...\n",
      "204: 0:00:02.171000 --  I have seen my son as a disappointment.\n",
      "205: 0:00:02.471000 --  A dreamer who excelled at nothing.\n",
      "206: 0:00:02.209000 --  It was not until Hiro began this quest...\n",
      "207: 0:00:04.851000 --  that I saw his strenght, courage and wisdom.\n",
      "208: 0:00:01.432000 --  There is a legacy...\n",
      "209: 0:00:03.226000 --  that I am meant to hand down to him.\n",
      "210: 0:00:01.939000 --  I will wait for Hiro to return.\n",
      "211: 0:00:02.985000 --  I am a man of patience.\n",
      "212: 0:00:01.415000 --  This can't be.\n",
      "213: 0:00:02.193000 --  Where did you get this newspaper?\n",
      "214: 0:00:01.575000 --  From your office.\n",
      "215: 0:00:01.705000 --  Sir, what is it?\n",
      "216: 0:00:01.545000 --  What does it mean?\n",
      "217: 0:00:04.182000 --  In twenty-four hours...\n",
      "218: 0:00:01.642000 --  I'll be dead.\n",
      "219: 0:00:01.927000 --  What are you doing here, ma?\n",
      "220: 0:00:02.610000 --  It's time to move on, Nathan, he's dead.\n",
      "221: 0:00:01.424000 --  You don't know that.\n",
      "222: 0:00:03.171000 --  Leave his stuff alone. He's gonna want it when he gets back.\n",
      "223: 0:00:01.356000 --  You're drunk.\n",
      "224: 0:00:02.487000 --  Thank god your father isn't here to see you.\n",
      "225: 0:00:01.668000 --  Or you, for that matter.\n",
      "226: 0:00:03.417000 --  You killed your brother. Drove Heidi away. Drove your kids away.\n",
      "227: 0:00:05.098000 --  If you'd followed our plan. If you'd done what you were supposed to do, he would be alive now.\n",
      "228: 0:00:02.029000 --  To think I almost listened to you.\n",
      "229: 0:00:01.422000 --  Yore evil, ma.\n",
      "230: 0:00:01.134000 --  Get out.\n",
      "231: 0:00:06.394000 --  I did it! What happened?\n",
      "232: 0:00:01.476000 --  How did we get here?\n",
      "233: 0:00:01.859000 --  I brought you here.\n",
      "234: 0:00:02.310000 --  They were about to put holes in you.\n",
      "235: 0:00:02.187000 --  Fifty ryo is not worth dying for.\n",
      "236: 0:00:03.067000 --  You can tell Takezo Kensei... he can keep his damn money.\n",
      "237: 0:00:02.310000 --  But if you're not Takezo Kensei...\n",
      "238: 0:00:01.174000 --  Then who is...\n",
      "239: 0:00:01.298000 --  What did you do?\n",
      "240: 0:00:03.225000 --  You made him run away! What did you do?\n",
      "241: 0:00:01.875000 --  Why did you make them scatter?\n",
      "242: 0:00:02.257000 --  If I put an arrow through that leader's heart.\n",
      "243: 0:00:01.725000 --  I would've been a very rich man.\n",
      "244: 0:00:01.379000 --  Takezo Kensei?\n",
      "245: 0:00:02.366000 --  What are you? Some sort of monk?\n",
      "246: 0:00:02.006000 --  You dress so strangely for a monk.\n",
      "247: 0:00:01.624000 --  And you wear glasses like a doctor.\n",
      "248: 0:00:01.315000 --  I'm not a monk.\n",
      "249: 0:00:02.255000 --  I'm your biggest fan.\n",
      "250: 0:00:03.303000 --  I know all about you, Takezo Kensei.\n",
      "251: 0:00:17.575000 --  I know all the stories about you! I stole your sword! You are the hero Kensei?\n",
      "252: 0:00:01.653000 --  My name here is Kensei.\n",
      "253: 0:00:02.747000 --  But no one's ever called me a hero before.\n",
      "254: 0:00:01.218000 --  Can you excuse me?\n",
      "255: 0:00:01.148000 --  You were late.\n",
      "256: 0:00:01.889000 --  It's my daughter's first day of high school.\n",
      "257: 0:00:03.363000 --  - Had to make sure she was okay. - And that's, uh, somehow my problem?\n",
      "258: 0:00:03.638000 --  That shipment of toner cartridges - came in last night. - I know. I was here.\n",
      "259: 0:00:02.514000 --  And when exactly were they going to get installed?\n",
      "260: 0:00:02.584000 --  Cause I don't see anybody else here doing it.\n",
      "261: 0:00:01.777000 --  I'm gonna do it this morning.\n",
      "262: 0:00:03.785000 --  And if i wasn't here watching your every move?\n",
      "263: 0:00:02.200000 --  You know, you've been here for a few months, Butler.\n",
      "264: 0:00:02.651000 --  I think it's time I saw some commitment to excellence from you.\n",
      "265: 0:00:05.136000 --  When I was assistant manager, We were fully set before the first customer walked through that door.\n",
      "266: 0:00:02.206000 --  That is how I got this.\n",
      "267: 0:00:02.732000 --  Paper business is dog eat dog.\n",
      "268: 0:00:02.091000 --  You gotta live it and breathe it.\n",
      "269: 0:00:02.384000 --  You gotta want it. Do you want it, Butler?\n",
      "270: 0:00:01.115000 --  Do you?\n",
      "271: 0:00:01.060000 --  Yes, sir.\n",
      "272: 0:00:02.856000 --  Well, we'll see.\n",
      "273: 0:00:09.518000 --  The company was formed 30 years ago with a group of like-minded individuals, ordinary men and women who were gifted with extraordinary powers.\n",
      "274: 0:00:02.314000 --  They wanted to help their own.\n",
      "275: 0:00:02.564000 --  To find them and to protect them.\n",
      "276: 0:00:04.585000 --  We find people, and we make sure they don't become dangerous.\n",
      "277: 0:00:05.770000 --  Now sometimes that can mean making sure they understand entirely what they're capable of.\n",
      "278: 0:00:03.694000 --  And teaching them to use their abilities for the good of mankind.\n",
      "279: 0:00:04.544000 --  And sometimes it can mean eliminating them.\n",
      "280: 0:00:02.536000 --  Who the hell are you to judge who lives and who dies?\n",
      "281: 0:00:05.713000 --  If i'm not mistaken, you yourself tried to put a bullet in the brain of a man named Sylar.\n",
      "282: 0:00:02.007000 --  - He was a monster. - Yes.\n",
      "283: 0:00:03.325000 --  And you were willing to kill him for the greater good.\n",
      "284: 0:00:04.905000 --  You acted on a moral imperative to protect your species.\n",
      "285: 0:00:02.103000 --  It doesn't matter one way or the other about Sylar.\n",
      "286: 0:00:01.533000 --  He's no longer a threat. He's dead.\n",
      "287: 0:00:01.839000 --  And now you have Molly.\n",
      "288: 0:00:03.861000 --  You and Matt Parkman are protecting her.\n",
      "289: 0:00:03.037000 --  Now we're not interfering with that arrangement.\n",
      "290: 0:00:01.561000 --  We offerent to help you.\n",
      "291: 0:00:03.861000 --  We have resources to offer you, Dr. Suresh.\n",
      "292: 0:00:03.795000 --  The plague. You talked about the disease which killed your sister, Shanti.\n",
      "293: 0:00:01.575000 --  - The virus. - Yes.\n",
      "294: 0:00:04.128000 --  We have the funds you need for your research.\n",
      "295: 0:00:10.884000 --  Now, can you imagine what would happen if that virus mutated and crossed over into the general population?\n",
      "296: 0:00:03.950000 --  Look, the type of research you're talking about is extremely expensive.\n",
      "297: 0:00:02.720000 --  Trust me. That won't be a problem.\n",
      "298: 0:00:03.859000 --  Let's just say we have our own private fort knox.\n",
      "299: 0:00:03.338000 --  So can we count you in?\n",
      "300: 0:00:01.568000 --  - Thank you. - You're welcome.\n",
      "301: 0:00:06 --  Dinner! Shouldn't I be eating some vegetables every once in awhile?\n",
      "302: 0:00:03.338000 --  Well, that is why I got you a vegetable pizza, smarty-pants.\n",
      "303: 0:00:01.960000 --  Plus I got your favorite rocky road for desert.\n",
      "304: 0:00:02.367000 --  You're just trying to bribe me 'cause you never cook.\n",
      "305: 0:00:03.840000 --  - I miss mohinder. He cooks. - Hey, I can cook.\n",
      "306: 0:00:02.984000 --  I just thought why not order pizza? Give us time to talk.\n",
      "307: 0:00:02.186000 --  Talk about what? This?\n",
      "308: 0:00:02.382000 --  Does that mean you passed your detective's exam?\n",
      "309: 0:00:01.899000 --  With flying colors. Why? You proud of me?\n",
      "310: 0:00:01.959000 --  Depends. Did you cheat?\n",
      "311: 0:00:01.300000 --  Why would you ask me that?\n",
      "312: 0:00:02.989000 --  Reading the answers out of people's minds, it's unfair.\n",
      "313: 0:00:02.361000 --  No, it is my natural talent.\n",
      "314: 0:00:02.899000 --  You wouldn't think a baseball player's cheating cause he's athletic, would you?\n",
      "315: 0:00:02.710000 --  It's not the same and you know it.\n",
      "316: 0:00:03.019000 --  You know what, I want to talk to you about these drawings that you made at school.\n",
      "317: 0:00:03.902000 --  - You're changing the subject. - Ms. Gerber's concerned and so am I.\n",
      "318: 0:00:03.652000 --  You don't want to talk about your exams, i don't want to talk about dreams.\n",
      "319: 0:00:01.440000 --  I want to help you.\n",
      "320: 0:00:11.866000 --  - I don't want you to be- - I said I didn't want to talk about it! Can I finish my dinner in my room?\n",
      "321: 0:00:01.404000 --  Sure. Go ahead.\n",
      "322: 0:00:02.054000 --  This book is incredible, Alejandro.\n",
      "323: 0:00:03.325000 --  - This man has figured it all out. - Yes.\n",
      "324: 0:00:02.372000 --  if he knows the cause, there has to be a cure.\n",
      "325: 0:00:03.524000 --  Yes, it's just that. God would not have done this to me...\n",
      "326: 0:00:02.203000 --  without a chance for salvation.\n",
      "327: 0:00:03.121000 --  Maya, it's not your fault.\n",
      "328: 0:00:01.729000 --  You have to believe that.\n",
      "329: 0:00:01.625000 --  You keep saying that...\n",
      "330: 0:00:02.789000 --  but your words don't make it any easier, Alejandro.\n",
      "331: 0:00:01.846000 --  Especially when I know what can happen.\n",
      "332: 0:00:01.439000 --  Nothing will happen.\n",
      "333: 0:00:02.734000 --  Not when I'm with you. I won't let it happen.\n",
      "334: 0:00:01.467000 --  Why did we stop?\n",
      "335: 0:00:01.163000 --  You guys.\n",
      "336: 0:00:01.124000 --  Come with me.\n",
      "337: 0:00:01.328000 --  Just stay here.\n",
      "338: 0:00:01.359000 --  What's the problem?\n",
      "339: 0:00:03.537000 --  Our financial arrangement... Did I say ten thousand Lempiras?\n",
      "340: 0:00:01.884000 --  What I meant to say was...\n",
      "341: 0:00:01.266000 --  ten thousand...\n",
      "342: 0:00:01.189000 --  for each of you.\n",
      "343: 0:00:02.039000 --  I remenber it was for both of us.\n",
      "344: 0:00:01.868000 --  Pardon me. I made a mistake.\n",
      "345: 0:00:01.282000 --  What I meant was...\n",
      "346: 0:00:01.642000 --  that you ride in the back...\n",
      "347: 0:00:02.842000 --  and your sister rides up front with me.\n",
      "348: 0:00:01.846000 --  I told you she stays with me.\n",
      "349: 0:00:03.526000 --  That's it... the deal, take it or leave it.\n",
      "350: 0:00:01.560000 --  You son of a bitch.\n",
      "351: 0:00:48.640000 --  You don't understand... for God's sake! You're making a mistake! Nice move, ballerina. How's that floor taste?\n",
      "352: 0:00:01.311000 --  Are you okay?\n",
      "353: 0:00:03.524000 --  Don't listen to them. I'm going to go find the birdie thing.\n",
      "354: 0:00:01.821000 --  - Thank you. - No problem.\n",
      "355: 0:00:01.111000 --  Robot.\n",
      "356: 0:00:02.900000 --  - So I'm a robot now, huh? - Far as I can tell.\n",
      "357: 0:00:01.851000 --  Okay. Birdie, please.\n",
      "358: 0:00:01.402000 --  You don't even know me.\n",
      "359: 0:00:03.379000 --  You had the answer today in class, but you didn't say it.\n",
      "360: 0:00:02.437000 --  You don't want people to know that you are smart.\n",
      "361: 0:00:02.483000 --  You just have me all figured out, huh?\n",
      "362: 0:00:01.758000 --  Know a robot when I see one.\n",
      "363: 0:00:03.270000 --  Come on, Martha. It's just a back flip off the tower.\n",
      "364: 0:00:02.483000 --  And you know the girls will catch you.\n",
      "365: 0:00:01.358000 --  Just leave her alone, okay?\n",
      "366: 0:00:01.897000 --  Okay, one- don't know you.\n",
      "367: 0:00:05.599000 --  And two- as captain of the cheerleading squad, it's totally within my rights to recruit talent where i see it.\n",
      "368: 0:00:03.956000 --  I think martha here has what it takes to be a cheerleader.\n",
      "369: 0:00:03.023000 --  So you can do a back tuck off the tower?\n",
      "370: 0:00:01.142000 --  What's the big deal?\n",
      "371: 0:00:02.390000 --  If it's so easy, why don't you try it?\n",
      "372: 0:00:05.722000 --  In fact, if you can do a back tuck off the tower, Martha here is off the hook.\n",
      "373: 0:00:02.074000 --  All right. I'll do it.\n",
      "374: 0:00:01.450000 --  This should be good.\n",
      "375: 0:00:01.434000 --  We're waiting.\n",
      "376: 0:00:01.317000 --  You're right.\n",
      "377: 0:00:01.220000 --  Can't do it.\n",
      "378: 0:00:01.560000 --  There's a shocker.\n",
      "379: 0:00:06.904000 --  Help me! Help me! Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me.\n",
      "380: 0:00:03.042000 --  I can see you.\n",
      "381: 0:00:02.270000 --  It's okay. It's okay.\n",
      "382: 0:00:01.884000 --  It's all right. It was just a dream.\n",
      "383: 0:00:02.827000 --  - It was just a dream. - My gosh, can see me.\n",
      "384: 0:00:02.965000 --  Did you see him? See what he look like?\n",
      "385: 0:00:02.564000 --  Okay, you tell me where he is and I will take care of him.\n",
      "386: 0:00:01.482000 --  He's too dangerous.\n",
      "387: 0:00:03.460000 --  If I tell you where he is, he'll kill you too.\n",
      "388: 0:00:02.903000 --  Nobody's going to kill anyone. I promise.\n",
      "389: 0:00:01.822000 --  I promise. I'm right here.\n",
      "390: 0:00:01.452000 --  Don't go, please.\n",
      "391: 0:00:01.498000 --  Why are you still here?\n",

      "393: 0:00:01.189000 --  Yes, I am.\n",
      "394: 0:00:02.564000 --  You were supposed to be back on the floor five minutes ago.\n",
      "395: 0:00:01.359000 --  There's a line of customers out there.\n",
      "396: 0:00:01.575000 --  Just finishing my coffee.\n",
      "397: 0:00:02.919000 --  No, you're finished. Get out there.\n",

      "400: 0:00:01.282000 --  Do you hear me?\n",
      "401: 0:00:01.529000 --  I hear you all right.\n",
      "402: 0:00:01.606000 --  Now you hear me.\n",
      "403: 0:00:02.393000 --  I am done eating your crap.\n",

      "405: 0:00:02.030000 --  I will take breaks when I want to.\n",
      "406: 0:00:03.939000 --  And you will not say a damn word to me ever again.\n",
      "407: 0:00:01.699000 --  Do you understand?\n",

      "411: 0:00:02.290000 --  my father read me tales of...\n",

      "413: 0:00:01.142000 --  I have to pee.\n",
      "414: 0:00:01.738000 --  Are you sure you're Takezo Kensei?\n",
      "415: 0:00:04.241000 --  Good name, eh? \"Kensei\"... means \"Sword Saint. \"\n",
      "416: 0:00:02.810000 --  Men think twice before they trifle with that.\n",
      "417: 0:00:02.842000 --  I trought of it when I got here from England.\n",
      "418: 0:00:01.282000 --  You are english?\n",
      "419: 0:00:01.699000 --  And there's a surprise.\n",
      "420: 0:00:03.537000 --  You know, there's very few locals here with whom I can speak plain.\n",
      "421: 0:00:03.325000 --  Thank god for you, young man. Sorry. sorry.\n",
      "422: 0:00:04.329000 --  So I came over on one of the few trade vessels your emperor let pass.\n",
      "423: 0:00:03.073000 --  The boat left full of tea, I kept on to find my fortune.\n",
      "424: 0:00:02.687000 --  You should see what I got paid to fend off those bandits.\n",
      "425: 0:00:03.228000 --  Kensei Takezo does not fight for money. He fights for honor.\n",
      "426: 0:00:02.749000 --  Really? Well, as long as it's honor I can spend.\n",
      "427: 0:00:01.251000 --  It's not a bad lot.\n",
      "428: 0:00:06.090000 --  I mean, I find a stout brute, put him on a horse, put him in a field, and tell him to shout on about how he's fearsome old Kensei.\n",
      "429: 0:00:03.537000 --  Then I repair to the branch of a tree and start to pick off the black guards one by one.\n",
      "430: 0:00:03.271000 --  - That's fighting dirty! - That's fighting smart, sir.\n",
      "431: 0:00:01.838000 --  What? I give him a fair wage.\n",
      "432: 0:00:01.297000 --  If he lives.\n",
      "433: 0:00:01.189000 --  This can't be.\n",
      "434: 0:00:03.444000 --  I come from the future. Many years from now.\n",
      "435: 0:00:02.208000 --  Your noble deeds become part of our history.\n",
      "436: 0:00:01.346000 --  - The future? - Yes.\n",
      "437: 0:00:02.306000 --  - That's a good one. - No, it is true.\n",
      "438: 0:00:01.622000 --  I know what happens to you.\n",
      "439: 0:00:04.124000 --  As a boy i read the book \"The trials of Takezo Kensei. \"\n",
      "440: 0:00:11.124000 --  How you killed the black bear of Sakashita, Your love of the swordsmith's daughter, and you defeat the terrible white bearded warlord and save the village of Otsu.\n",

      "442: 0:00:01.575000 --  What village is that?\n",
      "443: 0:00:01.390000 --  That would be Otsu.\n",
      "444: 0:00:03.219000 --  Sire, will you tell me what this is about?\n",
      "445: 0:00:01.606000 --  I am going to die.\n",

      "447: 0:00:01.467000 --  Who is it from?\n",
      "448: 0:00:01.235000 --  I don't know.\n",
      "449: 0:00:01.868000 --  Could be any of them.\n",

      "455: 0:00:03.186000 --  it's not safe here with me.\n",
      "456: 0:00:01.210000 --  I cannot.\n",
      "457: 0:00:01.529000 --  I cannot desert you now.\n",
      "458: 0:00:03.927000 --  It is for Hiro that I will stay and help you fight.\n",
      "459: 0:00:01.173000 --  Very well...\n",
      "460: 0:00:03.310000 --  If we are going to fight, then I will need a sword.\n",
      "461: 0:00:01.761000 --  Can you find me one?\n",
      "462: 0:00:01.529000 --  I'll be back as soon as I can.\n",

      "476: 0:00:07.382000 --  I sought redemption by helping Hiro fulfill his destiny to save the world.\n",
      "477: 0:00:02.023000 --  How did you help your son?\n",

      "480: 0:00:01.132000 --  What happened here?\n",
      "481: 0:00:03.800000 --  Bandits. They took everthing.\n",
      "482: 0:00:03.799000 --  Is there no God to protect us?\n",

      "490: 0:00:01.637000 --  It's a waste of time, huh?\n",
      "491: 0:00:04.201000 --  In the stories, you are rewarded with more gold than the emperor.\n",
      "492: 0:00:05.549000 --  And you took the swordsmith's daughter, the most beautiful woman in all Japan for your princess.\n",
      "493: 0:00:03.266000 --  We gave you everything we had to defend us.\n",
      "494: 0:00:01.560000 --  Now our homes are burned.\n",

      "499: 0:00:02.934000 --  I did, Yaeko. But this man got in the way.\n",
      "500: 0:00:04.205000 --  - My sword! - My sword! It's my father's sword.\n",

      "502: 0:00:01.868000 --  She's the swordsmith's daughter?\n",
      "503: 0:00:02.394000 --  and I don't think she wants to be my princess.\n",
      "504: 0:00:05.930000 --  Wait! Swordsmith's daughter! - Where are you going? - Someone must rescue my father.\n",

      "511: 0:00:01.220000 --  Right, Lyle?\n",
      "512: 0:00:01.930000 --  I don't know. I guess.\n",
      "513: 0:00:05.132000 --  So, Claire, Lyle was saying that his first day of school was uneventful.\n",
      "514: 0:00:02.301000 --  How about you? Anything special happen?\n",
      "515: 0:00:01.683000 --  No, nothing.\n",
      "516: 0:00:02.069000 --  I, uh, skated by unnoticed.\n",
      "517: 0:00:01.514000 --  I was like I wasn't even there.\n",
      "518: 0:00:01.467000 --  That's good, honey.\n",
      "519: 0:00:01.436000 --  And how about you, sweetheart?\n",

      "522: 0:00:02.295000 --  I made a calendar for...\n",
      "523: 0:00:03.320000 --  some grandparents. And a coworker brought in donuts.\n",
      "524: 0:00:01.209000 --  That's great.\n",
      "525: 0:00:04.108000 --  I just think it's amazing how well we have all adjusted to our new lives here.\n",
      "526: 0:00:01.915000 --  It's inspirational, really.\n",
      "527: 0:00:02.478000 --  The bennets were given lemons and what did we make?\n",
      "528: 0:00:02.004000 --  - Uh, Lemonade? - Exactly.\n",
      "529: 0:00:01.173000 --  I'll second that.\n",

      "532: 0:00:01.046000 --  Poor little guy.\n",
      "533: 0:00:05.243000 --  I mean, how do you go back to the farm after you have seen gay paris?\n",
      "534: 0:00:02.425000 --  n'est-ce pas? mais oui.\n",
